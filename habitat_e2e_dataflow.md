# Habitat End-to-End Dataflow

**Last Updated**: 2025-02-20T19:16:50-05:00

## Implementation Status

### Currently Implemented Flow
```
1. Document → Pattern Extraction
   - Document is ingested
   - Patterns are extracted from document
   - Initial validation occurs

2. Pattern Extraction → Graph Services
   - Patterns converted to concept-relationships
   - Relationships are structured for graph storage
   - Validation of graph structure

3. Graph Services → Neo4j
   - Concept-relationships stored in Neo4j
   - Graph relationships established
   - State versioning maintained
```

### Missing/Not Fully Defined Flows
```
1. Neo4j → Pattern-Aware RAG
   - How patterns are retrieved from Neo4j
   - How relationships are reconstructed
   - How patterns integrate with RAG context
   - How window states affect pattern retrieval

2. LLM Output → Graph Services → Neo4j
   - How LLM responses are converted to patterns
   - How new patterns are validated
   - How patterns are integrated with existing graph
   - How relationships are established with existing concepts
```

### Implementation Status
1. ✅ Document ingestion to Neo4j storage is well-defined
2. ❌ Neo4j to Pattern-Aware RAG flow needs definition
3. ❌ LLM output back to Neo4j needs definition

### Critical Gaps
The missing flows are critical because they:
1. Complete the feedback loop from Neo4j to RAG
2. Allow pattern evolution through LLM interactions
3. Enable continuous learning and pattern refinement

## Document to Neo4j Flow

### 1. Document Ingestion & Pattern Extraction
```python
pattern = await pattern_processor.extract_pattern(sample_document)
```
- Document is received by the Pattern Processor
- Initial pattern extraction occurs
- Basic validation of document structure

### 2. Adaptive ID Assignment
```python
adaptive_id = await pattern_processor.assign_adaptive_id(pattern)
```
- Pattern gets a unique adaptive ID
- Temporal and spatial context is initialized
- Version tracking begins

### 3. Graph State Preparation
```python
initial_state = await pattern_processor.prepare_graph_state(pattern, adaptive_id)
```
- Pattern is converted to graph format
- Node and relationship structures are created
- Initial state validation occurs

### 4. Coherence Alignment
```python
alignment = await coherence_interface.align_state(initial_state)
assert alignment.coherence_score > 0.0
```
- State is checked for coherence
- Pattern relationships are validated
- Coherence scores are calculated

### 5. Learning Window Processing
```python
window = window_manager.current_window
await window_manager.process_pattern(pattern)
```
- Pattern enters learning window
- State transitions are managed (CLOSED → OPENING → OPEN)
- Stability metrics are tracked

### 6. Neo4j State Storage
```python
neo4j_id = await state_stores["neo4j"].store_graph_state(initial_state)
```
- Graph state is persisted to Neo4j
- Node and relationship mappings are created
- State versioning is maintained

### 7. State History Recording
```python
mongo_id = await state_stores["mongo"].store_state_history(initial_state)
```
- State evolution history is recorded
- Temporal context is preserved
- Version transitions are tracked

### Key Features
1. **Natural Evolution**
   - Flow follows natural state transitions
   - Patterns emerge through gradual evolution
   - System maintains stability through back pressure

2. **Validation Layers**
   - Semantic validation during initialization
   - Structural validation during relations check
   - Coherence validation before persistence

3. **State Management**
   - Version control throughout flow
   - State synchronization between stores
   - Conflict resolution for concurrent updates

4. **Context Preservation**
   - Temporal context tracking
   - Spatial context management
   - Pattern relationship preservation

## Neo4j to Pattern-Aware RAG Flow

### 1. Pattern Retrieval from Neo4j
```python
stored_state = await state_stores["neo4j"].get_graph_state(neo4j_id)
```
- Graph state is retrieved from Neo4j
- Node and relationship structures are reconstructed
- Version information is validated

### 2. Learning Window Integration
```python
window = window_manager.current_window
assert window.state in ["CLOSED", "OPENING", "OPEN"]
```
- Pattern enters current learning window
- Window state determines processing flow
- Back pressure controls are applied

### 3. Dynamic Prompt Formation
```python
prompt = await prompt_engine.generate_prompt(
    query="test query",
    context_pattern=pattern,
    window_state=window_manager.current_window.state
)
```
- Context is gathered from Neo4j patterns
- Window state influences prompt structure
- Pattern relationships are incorporated

### 4. RAG Processing
```python
result = await pattern_aware_rag.process_with_patterns(
    query="test query",
    context={"pattern": pattern}
)
```
- Retrieved patterns augment query processing
- Pattern relationships guide context selection
- Window state influences processing priority

### 5. Pattern Evolution
```python
evolved_pattern = await pattern_aware_rag.get_evolved_pattern(pattern.id)
assert evolved_pattern.version > pattern.version
```
- Pattern evolution is tracked
- Version changes are managed
- Stability metrics are maintained

### Key Components

1. **State Management**
   - Version control for patterns
   - State synchronization
   - Coherence maintenance

2. **Window Control**
   - Natural flow regulation
   - Back pressure management
   - State transition control

3. **Pattern Integration**
   - Context-aware processing
   - Relationship utilization
   - Evolution tracking

4. **Response Analysis**
```python
analysis = await response_analyzer.analyze_response(response)
assert analysis.coherence_score > 0.0
assert analysis.pattern_alignment_score > 0.0
```
- Response quality validation
- Pattern alignment checking
- Coherence verification

5. **Pattern Extraction**
```python
extracted_patterns = await pattern_extractor.extract_patterns(response)
for pattern in extracted_patterns:
    assert pattern.coherence_score > 0.0
    assert pattern.stability_score > 0.0
```
- New pattern identification
- Quality metrics calculation
- Relationship extraction

### System Characteristics
1. Patterns maintain coherence through processing
2. Window states regulate pattern flow
3. System stability is preserved
4. Pattern relationships are leveraged
5. Natural evolution is supported

This creates a natural cycle where:
- Neo4j serves as the stable pattern store
- Learning windows manage pattern flow
- Pattern-Aware RAG uses patterns for context
- Evolution feeds back to Neo4j
