# Workshop Builder

This module implements a balanced approach to workshop setup and development, combining user-driven learning with agent-assisted automation. It demonstrates the optimal balance between manual implementation and automated assistance.

## Usage

### Build Workshop
To build the workshop environment:
```bash
python scripts/agentic/workshop_builder.py
```

### Clean Environment
To tear down the workshop environment:
```bash
python scripts/agentic/workshop_builder.py clean
```
