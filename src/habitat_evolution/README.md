# Habitat Evolution

A breakthrough pattern evolution system that combines field theory, wave mechanics, and information theory to detect, regulate, and evolve coherent patterns. Now featuring a revolutionary Pattern-Aware RAG architecture that transforms field-based observations into rich, data-embedded graph representations.

## Major Breakthrough: Pattern-Aware RAG as Coherence Interface

Habitat has achieved a fundamental breakthrough by implementing Pattern-Aware RAG as a coherence interface that:

1. **Sequential Pattern Processing Foundation**:
   - Pattern extraction with provenance tracking
   - Adaptive ID assignment for identity
   - Graph-ready state preparation
   - Foundational coherence establishment

2. **Concurrent Evolution Operations**:
   - Pattern enhancement through RAG
   - Evolution tracking with transactions
   - Graph state maintenance
   - Event-driven updates

3. **State Management and Evolution**:
   - Bidirectional flow for coherence direction
   - Back pressure for controlled evolution
   - Learning windows for stability
   - State agreement verification

4. **Integration Architecture**:
   - Neo4j for graph state persistence
   - MongoDB for evolution history
   - Claude for semantic processing
   - Event system for coordination

5. **Organized Component Structure**:
   - `/core`: Foundation components
   - `/bridges`: Integration layers
   - `/learning`: Control systems
   - `/state`: Evolution tracking
   - `/services`: External interfaces

## Scientific Foundation

The system validates pattern coherence through multiple scientific lenses:
1. **Wave Mechanics**: Phase relationships and interference patterns
2. **Field Theory**: Gradient propagation and field decay
3. **Information Theory**: Signal-to-noise ratios and entropy
4. **Flow Dynamics**: Viscosity and turbulence effects

## Usage Example

```python
from habitat_evolution.core.pattern.evolution import PatternEvolutionManager
from habitat_evolution.core.pattern.quality import PatternQualityAnalyzer

# Initialize components
quality_analyzer = PatternQualityAnalyzer(
    signal_threshold=0.3,
    noise_threshold=0.7
)

# Analyze pattern flow
flow_metrics = quality_analyzer.analyze_flow(pattern, history)

# Check coherence and stability
if flow_metrics.viscosity < 0.4 and flow_metrics.volume > 0.6:
    print("Pattern exhibits stable coherence")
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/src python -m pytest src/habitat_evolution/tests/pattern/test_gradient_regulation.py -v
```
