# Learning Control System

## Purpose

The learning module manages system stability and evolution through temporal windows, back pressure controls, and event coordination.

## Key Components

### Window Manager

Centralized learning window management:

```python
from habitat_evolution.pattern_aware_rag.learning import LearningWindowManager
```

#### Features
- Window lifecycle management
- Constraint application
- Back pressure coordination
- State transition control

#### Configuration
- Default window duration: 30 minutes
- Stability threshold: 0.7
- Coherence threshold: 0.6
- Max changes per window: 50

### Learning Windows

Temporal control for pattern evolution:

```python
from habitat_evolution.pattern_aware_rag.learning import LearningWindow
```

#### Features
- Duration management
- Change rate limiting
- Coherence thresholds
- Saturation detection
- Pattern evolution tracking

### Back Pressure Controller

System stability management:

```python
from habitat_evolution.pattern_aware_rag.learning import BackPressureController
```

#### Mechanisms
- Adaptive delay calculation
- Stability trend analysis
- Pressure management
- Change rate control

### Event Coordinator

Event sequencing and window management:

```python
from habitat_evolution.pattern_aware_rag.learning import EventCoordinator
```

#### Capabilities
- Event queuing
- Window tracking
- State coordination
- Change monitoring

## System States

### Learning Window States
1. CLOSED
   - No changes accepted
   - System stabilization

2. OPENING
   - Limited changes
   - Stability monitoring

3. OPEN
   - Full operation
   - Rate-limited changes

## Implementation Details

### Window Management
```python
def create_learning_window(
    self,
    duration_minutes: int = 30,
    stability_threshold: float = 0.7,
    coherence_threshold: float = 0.6,
    max_changes: int = 50
) -> LearningWindow:
    """Create and manage learning windows."""
```

### Back Pressure
```python
def calculate_delay(
    self,
    stability_score: float
) -> float:
    """Calculate adaptive delays."""
```

## Integration Points

### State Evolution
- Window-based control
- Change rate management
- Stability monitoring

### Pattern Evolution
- Learning window alignment
- Change coordination
- Pattern stability

### Event Processing
- Ordered processing
- Window tracking
- State coordination

## Testing Considerations

1. Window Management
   - State transitions
   - Change rate limits
   - Saturation handling

2. Back Pressure
   - Delay calculation
   - Stability trends
   - Pressure release

3. Event Coordination
   - Event ordering
   - Window tracking
   - State alignment
