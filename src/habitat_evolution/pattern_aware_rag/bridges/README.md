# Integration Bridges

## Purpose

The bridges module provides integration layers between different components of the Pattern-Aware RAG system, focusing on maintaining coherence and state alignment across subsystems.

## Key Components

### AdaptiveStateManager

Core bridge between graph state evolution and adaptive ID system:

```python
from habitat_evolution.pattern_aware_rag.bridges import AdaptiveStateManager
```

#### Responsibilities

1. State Transition Management
   - Validates state transitions
   - Maintains version history
   - Tracks pattern evolution

2. Coherence Maintenance
   - Ensures state alignment
   - Manages adaptive IDs
   - Tracks confidence metrics

3. Pattern Evolution
   - Links patterns to adaptive IDs
   - Manages pattern versions
   - Tracks stability metrics

## Integration Points

### Graph State
- Monitors state changes
- Validates transitions
- Updates adaptive IDs

### Adaptive ID System
- Creates and updates IDs
- Maintains version history
- Tracks confidence metrics

### Learning System
- Coordinates with learning windows
- Applies back pressure controls
- Manages change rates

## Implementation Details

### State Transaction Processing
```python
def process_state_transaction(
    self,
    transaction: StateTransaction
) -> Tuple[List[AdaptiveID], List[str]]:
    """Process state changes and update adaptive IDs."""
```

### Version History
```python
def _update_version_history(
    self,
    transaction: StateTransaction
):
    """Maintain coherent version history."""
```

## Testing Considerations

1. State Transition Validation
   - Coherence requirements
   - Version history accuracy
   - Pattern evolution tracking

2. Adaptive ID Management
   - ID creation/updates
   - Version maintenance
   - Confidence tracking

3. Integration Testing
   - State synchronization
   - Pattern evolution
   - System stability
