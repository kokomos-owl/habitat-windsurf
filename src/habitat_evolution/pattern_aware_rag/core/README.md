# Core Components

## Purpose

The core module provides essential system components and interfaces for the Pattern-Aware RAG system, establishing the foundation for state management and evolution tracking.

## Key Exports

### State Management

Core state handling components:

```python
from habitat_evolution.pattern_aware_rag.core import (
    GraphStateHandler,
    StateEvolutionTracker
)
```

#### Features
- State maintenance
- Evolution tracking
- Coherence validation
- Pattern management

### Adaptive Management

Integration components:

```python
from habitat_evolution.pattern_aware_rag.core import AdaptiveStateManager
```

#### Capabilities
- State transitions
- Pattern evolution
- Version history
- Coherence maintenance

### Learning Control

System stability components:

```python
from habitat_evolution.pattern_aware_rag.core import (
    EventCoordinator,
    LearningWindow,
    BackPressureController
)
```

#### Functions
- Window management
- Back pressure control
- Event coordination
- Stability maintenance

## System Architecture

### Component Interaction
1. State Foundation
   - Graph state base
   - Evolution tracking
   - Pattern management

2. Integration Layer
   - Adaptive bridges

## Implementation Details

### State Evolution
```python
def track_evolution(
    self,
    transaction: StateTransaction
) -> bool:
    """Track state evolution and maintain coherence."""
```

### Pattern Management
```python
def manage_patterns(
    self,
    patterns: List[Pattern],
    state: GraphStateSnapshot
):
    """Manage pattern evolution and stability."""
```
