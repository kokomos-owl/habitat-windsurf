## 4. Testing Sequence

1. Functional Testing
   ```python
   class TestPatternAwareRAG:
       """Test suite for Pattern-Aware RAG as a coherence interface."""
       
       def test_graph_state_initialization(self):
           """Test initial graph state loading and validation."""
           
       def test_prompt_formation_from_state(self):
           """Test how graph state shapes prompt formation."""
           
       def test_state_agreement_process(self):
           """Test the state agreement formation process."""
           
       def test_learning_window_activation(self):
           """Test learning window activation based on state agreement."""
           
       def test_coherence_state_tracking(self):
           """Test coherence state evolution."""
           
       def test_pattern_relationship_development(self):
           """Test pattern relationship formation within coherence context."""
   ```

2. Integration Testing
   ```python
   class TestPatternAwareRAGIntegration:
       """Integration tests for Pattern-Aware RAG system."""
       
       async def test_complete_coherence_cycle(self):
           """Test complete cycle from graph state through Claude to new state."""
           
       async def test_state_preservation(self):
           """Test preservation of coherence through the cycle."""
           
       async def test_back_pressure_integration(self):
           """Test back pressure effects in live system."""
   ```

## 5. Critical Considerations

1. State Primacy
   - Graph state is the foundation
   - All operations start with state
   - State coherence must be maintained

2. Back Pressure
   - Must be active throughout
   - Controls state change rate
   - Enables agreement formation

3. Coherence Interface
   - Not a traditional RAG system
   - Manages state alignment
   - Maintains system stability

4. Testing Order
   - Start with functional tests
   - Progress to integration
   - Maintain state focus
