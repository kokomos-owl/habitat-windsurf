# Bidirectional Processing Flow

## Overview

The Pattern-Aware RAG system implements a bidirectional flow architecture that enables dynamic pattern evolution through continuous feedback loops between document processing, pattern extraction, RAG enhancement, and graph integration.

## Core Architecture

```
Document → Pattern+ID → Graph-Ready → Evolution → Neo4j
                  Pattern-Aware RAG
                    (Learning Windows)
                  Pattern-Coherence
                    Co-Evolution

## 2. State Management

### Pattern-Aware RAG States
