# Pattern Quality Analysis Package

Last Updated: 2025-02-11 20:54:49 EST

## Implementation Status

### Current Issues
1. Signal Quality Analysis
   - Noise ratio detection not meeting threshold requirements
   - Signal strength normalization needs improvement
   - Persistence calculation requires refinement

2. Flow Dynamics
   - Viscosity bounds exceeded in flow calculations
   - Back pressure effects not properly scaled
   - Current calculations need normalization

### Test Failures
1. `test_analyze_noisy_signal`:
   - Current: noise_ratio = 0.244
   - Expected: noise_ratio > 0.6
   - Impact: Weak noise detection affecting pattern quality assessment

2. `test_analyze_flow_dynamics`:
   - Current: viscosity = 1.0
   - Expected: viscosity < 0.3
   - Impact: Flow dynamics not properly constrained

## Planned Improvements

### Signal Analysis
1. Enhanced Noise Detection
   - Implement multi-scale noise analysis
   - Add signal decomposition
   - Improve threshold adaptation

2. Flow Metrics
   - Add viscosity normalization
   - Implement bounded flow calculations
   - Enhance turbulence detection

### Quality Metrics
- Signal Strength: [0.0, 1.0]
- Noise Ratio: [0.0, 1.0]
- Persistence: [0.0, 1.0]
- Reproducibility: [0.0, 1.0]

### Flow Metrics
- Viscosity: [0.0, 0.3]
- Back Pressure: [0.0, 1.0]
- Volume: [0.0, 1.0]
- Current: [-1.0, 1.0]

## Next Steps
1. Implement signal decomposition for better noise detection
2. Add normalization to flow dynamics calculations
3. Enhance metric boundary enforcement
4. Add comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
