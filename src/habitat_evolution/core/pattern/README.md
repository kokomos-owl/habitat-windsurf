## Implementation Status

### Known Issues
1. Wave Mechanics Implementation
   - Phase evolution not properly tracked in wave mode
   - Pattern emergence rate calculation needs refinement
   - Wave parameter initialization incomplete

2. Quality Analysis
   - Noise ratio detection needs improvement
   - Flow dynamics bounds not properly enforced
   - Signal quality metrics require calibration

### Current Focus
1. Enhancing wave mechanics implementation
2. Refining quality analysis algorithms
3. Improving flow dynamics calculations
4. Adding comprehensive debug logging

## Components

### Evolution (`evolution.py`)

The `PatternEvolutionManager` class provides comprehensive pattern lifecycle management:

#### Features
- Pattern registration and tracking
- State transitions (EMERGING → STABLE → DECAYING)
- Relationship management
- Event notification

#### Usage
```python
manager = PatternEvolutionManager(pattern_store, relationship_store, event_bus)

# Register new pattern
manager.register_pattern({
    'id': 'pattern-1',
    'strength': 0.8,
    'phase': 0.0,
    'state': 'EMERGING'
})

# Update relationships
manager.link_patterns('pattern-1', 'pattern-2', 'reinforces')
```

### Quality Analysis (`quality.py`)

The `PatternQualityAnalyzer` provides sophisticated pattern quality assessment:

#### Metrics
1. **Signal Strength**
   - Amplitude measurement
   - Energy state tracking
   - Phase coherence

2. **Flow Dynamics**
   - Viscosity calculation
   - Volume assessment
   - Turbulence impact

3. **Coherence**
   - Phase relationship analysis
   - Interference pattern detection
   - Stability measurement

#### Usage
```python
analyzer = PatternQualityAnalyzer(
    signal_threshold=0.3,
    noise_threshold=0.7
)

# Analyze pattern
metrics = analyzer.analyze_signal(pattern, history)
if metrics.coherence > 0.8:
    print("High coherence pattern detected")
```

## Elemental Practice Tools

The pattern analysis system provides elemental tools for observing meaning-structure and concept-relationship transitions. These tools operate through temporal contexts (water/air states) that manifest at observable thresholds:

### Temporal Context Thresholds

1. **Water-like States** (Meaning-Structure)
   - Volume > 0.5: Stable structural coherence
   - Coherence > 0.3: Observable meaning formation
   - Back-pressure balanced with energy state
   - Represents stable, observable meaning structures

2. **Air-like States** (Concept-Relationship)
   - Viscosity < 0.4: High adaptability
   - Flow potential > 0.7: Strong relationship capacity
   - Near-zero current at equilibrium
   - Enables fluid concept relationships

### Practice Applications

1. **Observable Transitions**
   - Thresholds mark where meaning-structure and concept-relationship become mutually observable
   - State transitions reveal emergent understanding
   - Pattern relationships self-organize at these boundaries

2. **Gradient-Mediated Equilibrium**
   - High-energy patterns provide structure
   - Low-energy patterns create flow channels
   - Middle-energy patterns mediate transitions

3. **Usage as Practice Tools**
   - Monitor threshold crossings for emergence
   - Use gradient relationships to guide evolution
   - Allow equilibrium to emerge naturally
   - Trust the process of self-organization

## Pattern States

1. **EMERGING**
   - Initial pattern detection
   - Signal strengthening
   - Phase stabilization

2. **STABLE**
   - Strong signal
   - Consistent phase
   - Clear relationships

3. **DECAYING**
   - Weakening signal
   - Phase disruption
   - Relationship dissolution

## Best Practices

### Pattern Registration
1. Always include:
   - Unique identifier
   - Signal strength
   - Phase information
   - Initial state

### Quality Assessment
1. Consider multiple factors:
   - Signal-to-noise ratio
   - Phase coherence
   - Flow characteristics
   - Relationship strength

### Flow Management
1. Monitor:
   - Viscosity trends
   - Volume changes
   - Turbulence effects
   - Gradient propagation
