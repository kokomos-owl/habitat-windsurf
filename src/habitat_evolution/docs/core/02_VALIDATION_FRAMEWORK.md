# Pattern Evolution Validation Framework

## Overview

The validation framework ensures natural pattern evolution through a comprehensive suite of critical tests. Each test validates specific aspects of pattern behavior and field interactions.

## Critical Test Suite

### 1. Turbulence Impact Test
```python
test_turbulence_impact_on_viscosity():
    # Incoherent patterns: viscosity > 0.8
    # Coherent patterns: viscosity < 0.5
```
Validates differential response to turbulence based on coherence levels.

### 2. Density Effects Test
```python
test_density_impact_on_volume():
    # Low density → reduced volume and back pressure
    # High density → increased volume and back pressure
```
Validates coupling between field density and pattern dynamics.

### 3. Gradient Flow Test
```python
test_gradient_based_flow():
    # Strong gradients (0.4, 0.3) → higher current
    # Weak gradients (0.7, 0.7) → lower current
```
Validates gradient-driven pattern movement.

### 4. Pattern Dissipation Test
```python
test_incoherent_pattern_dissipation():
    # Conditions:
    #   - coherence = 0.2
    #   - turbulence = 0.8
    # Validates:
    #   - current < -1.5
    #   - viscosity > 0.9
    #   - volume < 0.3
```
Demonstrates natural dissipation of incoherent patterns.

### 5. Pattern Stability Test
```python
test_coherent_pattern_stability():
    # Conditions:
    #   - coherence = 0.9
    #   - turbulence = 0.4
    # Validates:
    #   - viscosity < 0.4
    #   - volume > 0.6
    #   - |current| < 1.0
```
Demonstrates natural stability of coherent patterns.

### 6. Adaptive Response Test
```python
test_adaptive_regulation():
    # Tests response to turbulence [0.0-0.8]
    # Validates monotonic changes in:
    #   - viscosity
    #   - volume
    #   - current
```
Demonstrates smooth adaptation to changing conditions.

## Validation Principles

1. **Natural Evolution**
   - Patterns evolve based on coherence
   - Field conditions guide behavior
   - No explicit behavior rules

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Tests all pattern states
   - Validates field interactions
   - Ensures adaptive responses

3. **Measurable Outcomes**
   - Quantifiable metrics
   - Clear thresholds
   - Reproducible results
