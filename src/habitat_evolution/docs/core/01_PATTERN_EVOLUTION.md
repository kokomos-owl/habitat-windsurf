# Pattern Evolution Core System

## Overview

The Pattern Evolution system implements natural pattern emergence and evolution through field-driven regulation rather than explicit rules. This document outlines the core mechanisms and principles.

## Key Mechanisms

### 1. Flow Dynamics

#### Coherent Patterns (>0.3)
- **Turbulence Impact**: Reduced (0.5x multiplier)
- **Flow Characteristics**:
  * Gradient-driven flow
  * Cross-pattern interactions
  * Stable volume maintenance

#### Incoherent Patterns (≤0.3)
- **Turbulence Impact**: Amplified (2.0x multiplier)
- **Flow Characteristics**:
  * Exponential viscosity growth
  * Strong negative flow
  * Volume reduction

### 2. Field Gradients

Field gradients drive pattern evolution through four primary mechanisms:
1. **Coherence Gradient** → Determines flow direction
2. **Energy Gradient** → Controls flow magnitude
3. **Density** → Influences volume and pressure
4. **Turbulence** → Affects viscosity and dissipation

### 3. Adaptive Thresholds

The system employs dynamic thresholds that adapt to:
- Pattern age
- Noise variations
- Field feedback
- Local gradient conditions

### 4. Pattern States

Patterns transition through defined states based on their characteristics:

| State | Characteristics |
|-------|----------------|
| EMERGING | High strength, low persistence |
| STABLE | High strength, persistence, reproducibility |
| DECLINING | Low strength, high back pressure |
| TRANSFORMING | High current, low persistence |
| NOISE | Below dynamic thresholds |

## Implementation Principles

1. **Field-Driven Regulation**
   - Patterns evolve based on field conditions
   - No explicit rules govern behavior
   - Natural emergence through interaction

2. **Differential Treatment**
   - Coherent vs incoherent patterns
   - Response varies with field conditions
   - Adaptive threshold application

3. **Natural Evolution**
   - Self-organizing behavior
   - Emergent properties
   - Field-mediated interactions
