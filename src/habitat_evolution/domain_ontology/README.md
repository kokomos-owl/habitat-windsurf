# Domain Ontology

## Overview
The Domain Ontology system manages concept models and knowledge graphs for pattern evolution.

## Components

### Concept Models
- Pattern concepts
- Field relationships
- Evolution rules
- State transitions

### Knowledge Graphs
- Pattern relationships
- Field interactions
- Evolution pathways
- State mappings
