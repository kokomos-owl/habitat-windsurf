Harmonic Repository Mixin

This mixin adds harmonic I/O capabilities to repositories, ensuring that
database operations don't disrupt the natural evolution of eigenspaces and
pattern detection.

It intercepts repository operations and routes them through the HarmonicIOService
to ensure they are scheduled according to harmonic timing that preserves the
natural flow of pattern evolution in the system.
