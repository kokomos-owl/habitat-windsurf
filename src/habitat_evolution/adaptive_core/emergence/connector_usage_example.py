Vector-Tonic Persistence Connector Usage Example.

This module demonstrates how to use the Vector-Tonic Persistence Connector
in a real-world scenario, processing documents and capturing patterns,
field states, and relationships in ArangoDB.

                patterns are affecting crop yields and water availability. Adaptation strategies

                1. Temperature increases of 1.5Â°C will reduce crop yields by 5-10% in tropical regions
