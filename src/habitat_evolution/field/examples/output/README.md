# Example Outputs

This directory contains outputs from the eigenspace navigation examples, including:

1. Visualizations:
   - 2D/3D eigenspace plots
   - Community boundary visualizations
   - Dimensional resonance charts
   - Navigation path visualizations

2. Analysis Results:
   - Pattern detection metrics
   - Community structure analysis
   - Boundary fuzziness measurements
   - Dimensional resonance relationships

3. Performance Data:
   - Pattern detection comparisons
   - Query performance metrics
   - Memory usage statistics

Each example run will create a timestamped subdirectory to store its outputs, allowing for easy comparison of results across different runs or parameter configurations.
