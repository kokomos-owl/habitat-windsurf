# Temporal Pattern Processing

This directory contains components for temporal pattern processing using flow-based mechanics.

## Key Components

### AdaptiveWindow

The `adaptive_window.py` module implements a fluid dynamics inspired approach to pattern processing. Instead of using discrete states, it employs continuous flow metrics to naturally adapt to changing system conditions.

Key concepts:
- Input/Output Pressure: Measures pattern density and system backpressure
- Pressure Differential: Drives pattern flow rates
- Flow Rate: Determines processing speed and capacity
- Buffer Management: Influences pressure and flow calculations

Example usage:
```python
manager = WindowStateManager()
window = await manager.create_window(
    window_id="my_window",
    flow_threshold=0.5
)
success = await manager.process_pattern("my_window", pattern)
```

### WindowTracker

The `window_tracker.py` module coordinates multiple adaptive windows and manages system-wide flow dynamics. It ensures smooth pattern processing across different temporal contexts.

Features:
- Multi-window coordination
- Flow-based backpressure handling
- Adaptive processing rates
- Natural emergence of temporal patterns

## Flow-Based Design

This implementation moves away from traditional discrete state machines (OPENING, ACTIVE, CLOSING) to a more natural flow-based approach. Benefits include:

1. Natural Adaptation
   - Continuous response to changing conditions
   - Smooth transitions without state boundaries
   - Better handling of edge cases

2. Improved Stability
   - Built-in backpressure management
   - Automatic flow rate adjustment
   - Buffer capacity awareness

3. System Integration
   - Aligns with Habitat's flow-based architecture
   - Supports pattern emergence and evolution
   - Enables natural temporal relationships

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests in `tests/temporal/`:
- `test_flow_window.py`: Tests flow-based pattern processing
- Flow rate adaptation
- Backpressure regulation
- Capacity management

## Future Enhancements

1. Enhanced Flow Metrics
   - Pattern velocity tracking
   - Energy state monitoring
   - Cross-pattern flow analysis

2. Advanced Flow Control
   - Multi-dimensional flow spaces
   - Dynamic pressure mapping
   - Adaptive flow thresholds

3. Visualization
   - Real-time flow visualization
   - Pressure differential mapping
   - Temporal pattern networks
