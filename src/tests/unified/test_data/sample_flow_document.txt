Climate Risk Assessment - Vineyard Sound & Woods Hole Region
Integrated Marine and Coastal System Analysis

This assessment examines climate-related risks to marine ecosystems
in the Vineyard Sound and Woods Hole region, with a focus on
temperature changes, sea level rise, and ocean acidification.

The study integrates multiple data sources and modeling approaches
to provide a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts.

Key findings include:
1. Temperature trends show accelerated warming
2. Sea level rise projections indicate increased risk
3. Ocean chemistry changes affect marine life

Recommendations:
- Enhance monitoring systems
- Develop adaptation strategies
- Coordinate regional responses
