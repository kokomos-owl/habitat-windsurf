# Integrating Field with ID Components

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating the Field module with the Adaptive ID and Pattern ID components in the Habitat Evolution system. The integration is critical for enabling bidirectional learning and proper state change propagation across the system.

## Background

The Field module and ID components were initially developed independently to allow for faster iteration and clear separation of concerns. This approach enabled:

1. Independent validation of the Vector + Tonic-Harmonic approach in the Field module
2. Focused development of identity and state tracking in the ID components
3. Reduced development complexity by addressing one challenging problem at a time

Now that both systems have matured, we need to integrate them to enable the full potential of the Habitat system as a bidirectional learning space.

## Current Gap Analysis

The current implementation has the following gaps:

1. **State Change Context Gap**:
   - Field module focuses on analysis but not on maintaining state context across interactions
   - No mechanism to propagate field state changes back to the adaptive_id system
   - Lack of unified state representation between field analysis and ID components

2. **Bidirectional Learning Limitations**:
   - BackPressureController cannot properly regulate field state changes without context
   - Pattern evolution tracking lacks consistent state representation across components
   - IO alignment is impeded by the lack of proper state context propagation

3. **Tonic-Harmonic and Eigenspace-ID Integration Gap**:
   - Tonic-harmonic resonance patterns are not fully represented in the ID system
   - Eigenspace properties of patterns are not tracked in the ID system
   - Resonance relationships between patterns are not preserved in Neo4j
   - Benefits of vector + tonic-harmonic approaches are not fully represented in ID space
   - AdaptiveID currently privileges vector-based properties over tonic-harmonic properties
