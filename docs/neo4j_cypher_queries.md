# Neo4j Cypher Queries: Pattern Language Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines our approach to implementing a pattern language for climate risk analysis using Neo4j. The core idea is to represent natural language descriptions as graph patterns that preserve semantic meaning while enabling complex analysis.

## 1. Basic Pattern Structure

### Single Statement Pattern
```cypher
// Example: "Climate change leads to increased rainfall probability"
CREATE (driver:Pattern {
    name: "Climate Change",
    meaning: "Primary force driving change"
})

CREATE (mechanism:Pattern {
    name: "Increasing Probability",
    meaning: "How change manifests"
})

CREATE (driver)-[:LEADS_TO {context: "through warming"}]->(mechanism)
```

### Reading the Pattern
The above creates a readable statement:
- "Climate Change LEADS_TO Increasing Probability (through warming)"

## 2. Pattern Evolution

### Adding Temporal Context
```cypher
// Adding future projections
CREATE (current:Pattern {
    name: "Current State",
    timeframe: "present"
})

CREATE (future:Pattern {
    name: "Future State",
    timeframe: "2050"
})

CREATE (current)-[:EVOLVES_TO {
    confidence: 0.8,
    basis: "climate projections"
}]->(future)
```

## 3. Query Patterns

### Basic Story Query
```cypher
// Read the basic narrative
MATCH (start:Pattern)-[r]->(end:Pattern)
RETURN start.name, type(r), r.context, end.name
```

### Evolution Query
```cypher
// Follow pattern evolution
MATCH path = (start:Pattern)-[:EVOLVES_TO*]->(end:Pattern)
RETURN path
```

## 4. Implementation Examples

### Climate Risk Pattern
```cypher
// "The 100-year rainfall event becomes more likely due to climate change"
CREATE (climate:Pattern {name: "Climate Change"})
CREATE (rainfall:Pattern {name: "100-year Rainfall"})
CREATE (probability:Pattern {name: "Increased Probability"})

CREATE (climate)-[:INFLUENCES]->(rainfall)
CREATE (rainfall)-[:SHOWS]->(probability)
```

## 5. Best Practices

1. Pattern Creation
   - Start with simple statements
   - Build natural relationships
   - Add context through properties

2. Relationship Design
   - Use verb-based relationships
   - Make paths readable
   - Include contextual properties

3. Query Design
   - Follow narrative structure
   - Return meaningful paths
   - Preserve context

## 6. Future Development

1. Pattern Extension
   - Add correlated patterns
   - Build nested narratives
   - Connect parallel stories

2. Query Enhancement
   - Temporal analysis
   - Confidence scoring
   - Pattern evolution tracking
