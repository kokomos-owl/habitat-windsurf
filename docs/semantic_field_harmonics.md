# Semantic Field Harmonics: Multi-Dimensional Pattern Relationships in Habitat

## Overview

Semantic Field Harmonics extends Habitat's field-state architecture by modeling pattern relationships in multi-dimensional field space. This approach enables the system to capture both harmonic and dissonant relationships, measure coherence at multiple levels, and anticipate emergent patternsâ€”all while maintaining scalar-based calculations without vector embeddings.

## Core Principles

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Field Space

Patterns exist in a multi-dimensional field where relationships form through natural field interactions rather than vector similarity. This geometric approach captures the full complexity of semantic relationships, including complementary, contrasting, and boundary-defining interactions.

#### Implementation

```python
class SemanticFieldHarmonics:
    def __init__(self, dimensions=3):
        self.dimensions = dimensions  # Number of semantic dimensions to track
        self.field_geometry = {}      # Maps pattern IDs to positions in field
        
    def position_pattern(self, pattern):
        """Position pattern in multi-dimensional field based on properties"""
        # Calculate dimensional coordinates based on pattern properties
        position = []
        
        # Dimension 1: Base frequency (similar to our original approach)
        position.append(pattern.natural_frequency)
        
        # Dimension 2: Energy decay rate (how quickly pattern loses coherence)
        decay_rate = self._calculate_decay_rate(pattern)
        position.append(decay_rate)
        
        # Dimension 3: Dissonance potential (ability to form contrasting relationships)
        dissonance = self._calculate_dissonance_potential(pattern)
        position.append(dissonance)
        
        self.field_geometry[pattern.id] = position
        return position

    def _calculate_decay_rate(self, pattern):
        """Calculate how quickly a pattern's energy decays over time"""
        # Factors affecting decay rate:
        # - Specificity (more specific = slower decay)
        # - Content length (longer content = slower decay)
        # - Semantic density (denser = slower decay)
        
        word_count = len(pattern.content.split())
        specific_terms = sum(1 for word in pattern.content.lower().split() 
                            if len(word) > 8)  # Longer words often more specific
        
        # Simple calculation - adjust weights as needed
        specificity_factor = (specific_terms / max(1, word_count)) * 2
        length_factor = min(1.0, word_count / 200)  # Cap at 200 words
        
        # Lower decay rate = slower decay
        decay_rate = 1.0 - ((specificity_factor * 0.5) + (length_factor * 0.5))
        return max(0.1, min(0.9, decay_rate))  # Keep within reasonable bounds
```

### 2. Structured Dissonance as Signal

Dissonance is treated as a valuable semantic signal rather than noise, enabling the system to capture contrasting perspectives and boundary-defining relationships.

#### Implementation

```python
    def _calculate_dissonance_potential(self, pattern):
        """Calculate pattern's potential for dissonant relationships"""
        # Factors that increase dissonance potential:
        # - Presence of negation words
        # - Contrasting sentiment changes
        # - Presence of qualifying/exception terms
        
        negation_count = sum(1 for word in pattern.content.lower().split() 
                            if word in ["not", "never", "no", "cannot", "without"])
        
        contrast_terms = sum(1 for word in pattern.content.lower().split() 
                            if word in ["but", "however", "although", "despite", "contrary"])
        
        # Combine factors
        dissonance_potential = (negation_count * 0.7) + (contrast_terms * 0.3) + 0.1
        return dissonance_potential
        
    def calculate_field_interaction(self, pattern1, pattern2):
        """Calculate how patterns interact in geometric field space"""
        pos1 = self.field_geometry.get(pattern1.id)
        pos2 = self.field_geometry.get(pattern2.id)
        
        if not pos1 or not pos2:
            return None
            
        # Constructive interference (harmony)
        harmony = self._calculate_constructive_interference(pos1, pos2)
        
        # Destructive interference (dissonance)
        dissonance = self._calculate_destructive_interference(pos1, pos2)
        
        # Overall interaction strength (can be harmonious or dissonant)
        interaction_strength = harmony - dissonance
        
        # Interaction type (whether primarily harmonic or dissonant)
        interaction_type = "harmonic" if harmony > dissonance else "dissonant"
        
        return {
            "strength": abs(interaction_strength),
            "type": interaction_type,
            "harmony": harmony,
            "dissonance": dissonance
        }
```

### 3. Multi-Level Coherence

Coherence exists at multiple interconnected levels: semantic coherence (internal consistency of individual patterns), pattern coherence (relationship strength between pattern pairs), and field coherence (overall coherence of the entire field).

#### Implementation

```python
class MultiLevelCoherence:
    def __init__(self, field_harmonics):
        self.field_harmonics = field_harmonics
        
    def measure_semantic_coherence(self, pattern):
        """Measure internal consistency of individual patterns"""
        # Break into sentences for analysis
        sentences = pattern.content.split('.')
        
        # Measure topic consistency, logical flow, reference maintenance
        topic_shifts = self._detect_topic_shifts(sentences)
        reference_breaks = self._detect_reference_breaks(sentences)
        
        # Calculate overall semantic coherence
        coherence = 1.0 - ((topic_shifts * 0.4) + (reference_breaks * 0.6))
        return max(0.1, min(0.9, coherence))
        
    def measure_pattern_coherence(self, pattern1, pattern2):
        """Measure relationship strength between pattern pairs"""
        # Get field interaction metrics
        interaction = self.field_harmonics.calculate_field_interaction(pattern1, pattern2)
        
        if not interaction:
            return 0.0
            
        # Pattern coherence can come from either harmony or meaningful dissonance
        if interaction['type'] == 'harmonic':
            return interaction['harmony']
        else:
            # Dissonance contributes to coherence if it's structured and meaningful
            return interaction['dissonance'] * 0.8  # Slight penalty for dissonance
            
    def measure_field_coherence(self, patterns):
        """Measure overall coherence of the entire field"""
        if not patterns:
            return 0.0
            
        total_coherence = 0.0
        pair_count = 0
        
        # Calculate coherence between all pattern pairs
        for i, p1 in enumerate(patterns):
            # First check semantic coherence of individual pattern
            total_coherence += self.measure_semantic_coherence(p1)
            
            # Then check coherence with other patterns
            for p2 in patterns[i+1:]:
                pair_coherence = self.measure_pattern_coherence(p1, p2)
                total_coherence += pair_coherence
                pair_count += 1
                
        # Average coherence across all measurements
        return total_coherence / (len(patterns) + pair_count)
```

### 4. Anticipation Through Energy Gradients

The field state includes energy gradients that enable the system to anticipate where new patterns might emerge or how existing patterns might evolve.

#### Implementation

```python
class AnticipationField:
    def __init__(self):
        self.energy_map = {}  # Maps field positions to energy levels
        self.gradient_history = []  # Track energy flow over time
        
    def update_energy_gradient(self, pattern1, pattern2, interaction):
        """Update energy flow direction based on interaction type and strength"""
        pos1 = pattern1.field_position
        pos2 = pattern2.field_position
        
        # Energy flows from lower coherence to higher coherence
        if pos1 in self.energy_map and pos2 in self.energy_map:
            energy_diff = self.energy_map[pos2] - self.energy_map[pos1]
            flow_strength = interaction['strength'] * energy_diff
            
            # Record energy flow
            self.gradient_history.append({
                'source': pos1,
                'target': pos2,
                'strength': flow_strength,
                'timestamp': time.time()
            })
            
    def anticipate_emergent_patterns(self, existing_patterns, threshold=0.7):
        """Anticipate where new patterns might emerge based on energy gradients"""
        potential_emergence_points = []
        
        # Find areas of high energy convergence
        for p1 in existing_patterns:
            for p2 in existing_patterns:
                if p1.id == p2.id:
                    continue
                    
                key1 = (p1.id, p2.id)
                key2 = (p2.id, p1.id)
                
                gradient1 = self.energy_gradients.get(key1, 0)
                gradient2 = self.energy_gradients.get(key2, 0)
                
                # Convergent gradients indicate potential emergence point
                if gradient1 > 0 and gradient2 > 0:
                    convergence = (gradient1 + gradient2) / 2
                    
                    if convergence > threshold:
                        potential_emergence_points.append({
                            "source_patterns": [p1, p2],

        # Higher convergence = closer to midpoint
        weight = 0.5  # Start at midpoint

## Rich Pattern Relationships

The multi-dimensional field enables recognition of diverse relationship types:

### 1. Complementary Patterns

Patterns that complete each other, creating a more comprehensive understanding when combined.

```python
class ComplementaryPatternDetector:
    def __init__(self, field_harmonics, coherence_analyzer):
        self.field_harmonics = field_harmonics
        self.coherence_analyzer = coherence_analyzer
        
    def find_complementary_pairs(self, patterns, threshold=0.6):
        """Find pattern pairs with high coherence gain when combined"""
        complementary_pairs = []
        
        for i, p1 in enumerate(patterns):
            for p2 in patterns[i+1:]:
                # Measure individual coherences
                p1_coherence = self.coherence_analyzer.measure_semantic_coherence(p1)
                p2_coherence = self.coherence_analyzer.measure_semantic_coherence(p2)
                
                # Measure combined coherence
                combined_coherence = self._measure_combined_coherence(p1, p2)
                
                # Calculate improvement
                improvement = combined_coherence - max(p1_coherence, p2_coherence)
                
                if improvement > threshold:
                    complementary_pairs.append({
                        'pattern1': p1,
                        'pattern2': p2,
                        'improvement': improvement,
                        'combined_coherence': combined_coherence
                    })
                    
        return sorted(complementary_pairs, key=lambda x: x['improvement'], reverse=True)
```

### 2. Sequential Relationships

Patterns with natural temporal or logical order.

```python
class SequentialRelationshipDetector:
    def __init__(self, field_harmonics):
        self.field_harmonics = field_harmonics
        
    def detect_sequences(self, patterns, min_sequence_length=3):

                if not next_pattern or next_pattern.id in visited:
                    break
                    
                current_sequence.append(next_pattern)

                current_pattern = next_pattern
                
            if len(current_sequence) >= min_sequence_length:
                sequences.append({
                    'patterns': current_sequence,
                    'length': len(current_sequence),
                    'coherence': self._calculate_sequence_coherence(current_sequence)
                })
                
        return sorted(sequences, key=lambda x: x['coherence'], reverse=True)
        
    def _find_next_in_sequence(self, current_pattern, all_patterns):
        """Find the pattern that most naturally follows the current one"""
        best_next = None
        best_score = 0
        
        for pattern in all_patterns:
            if pattern.id == current_pattern.id:
                continue
                
            # Check sequential relationship strength
            score = self._check_sequential_relationship(current_pattern, pattern)
            if score > best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_next = pattern
                
        return best_next if best_score > 0.6 else None
```

## Integration with Habitat

The Semantic Field Harmonics approach integrates seamlessly with Habitat's field-state architecture:

```python
class SemanticFieldState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.field_harmonics = SemanticFieldHarmonics(dimensions=3)
        self.coherence_analyzer = MultiLevelCoherence(self.field_harmonics)

    def process_pattern(self, pattern):
        """Process a pattern through the semantic field"""
        # Calculate natural frequency if not set
        if pattern.natural_frequency is None:
            pattern.calculate_natural_frequency()

## Applied Examples with Climate Risk Documents

The Semantic Field Harmonics approach can be applied to analyze climate risk documents, capturing rich relationships that go beyond traditional similarity measures.

### Example: Processing Climate Risk Documents

```python
def analyze_climate_risk_documents():
    """Analyze climate risk documents using Semantic Field Harmonics"""
    # Initialize the field state
    field_state = SemanticFieldState()
    
    # Load climate risk documents
    documents = [
        "climate_risk_marthas_vineyard.txt",
        "basic_test_doc_cape_code.txt",
        "temporal_analysis_plum_island.txt",
        "complex_test_doc_boston_harbor_islands.txt"
    ]
    
    all_patterns = []
    
    # Process each document
    for doc_path in documents:
        # Load document content
        with open(f"data/climate_risk/{doc_path}", "r") as file:
            content = file.read()
            
        # Extract natural patterns
        pattern_extractor = NaturalPatternExtractor()
        patterns = pattern_extractor.extract_natural_patterns(content)
        
        print(f"Extracted {len(patterns)} patterns from {doc_path}")
        
        # Process each pattern through the field
        for pattern in patterns:
            result = field_state.process_pattern(pattern)
            all_patterns.append(pattern)
            
    # Analyze relationships
    print("\nAnalyzing pattern relationships...")
    
    # Find complementary patterns
    complementary_pairs = field_state.complementary_detector.find_complementary_pairs(
        all_patterns)
    print(f"Found {len(complementary_pairs)} complementary pattern pairs")
    
    # Find sequential relationships
    sequences = field_state.sequence_detector.detect_sequences(all_patterns)
    print(f"Found {len(sequences)} sequential pattern chains")
    
    # Identify knowledge gaps
    gaps = field_state.anticipation_field.identify_knowledge_gaps(all_patterns)
    print(f"Identified {len(gaps)} potential knowledge gaps")
    
    # Visualize field state
    visualize_field_state(field_state)
    
    return {
        "patterns": all_patterns,
        "complementary_pairs": complementary_pairs,
        "sequences": sequences,
        "knowledge_gaps": gaps,
        "field_state": field_state
    }

def visualize_field_state(field_state):
    """Create visualization of semantic field state"""
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
    
    # Create 3D plot
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    
    # Plot pattern positions
    positions = []
    for pattern_id, pos in field_state.field_harmonics.field_geometry.items():
        positions.append(pos)
    
    if positions:
        positions = np.array(positions)
        ax.scatter(positions[:, 0], positions[:, 1], positions[:, 2], 
                  c='b', marker='o', label='Patterns')
    
    # Plot energy gradients
    for gradient in field_state.anticipation_field.gradient_history[-20:]:
        source = np.array(gradient['source'])
        target = np.array(gradient['target'])
        strength = gradient['strength']
        
        # Draw arrow from source to target
        arrow = Arrow3D([source[0], target[0]],
                       [source[1], target[1]],
                       [source[2], target[2]],

                       lw=1, arrowstyle="->",
                       color='r', alpha=min(1.0, strength))
        ax.add_artist(arrow)

## Key Benefits

1. **Natural Pattern Emergence**
   - Relationships emerge through field interactions
   - Both harmony and dissonance contribute meaningfully
   - Uses scalar mathematics throughout

2. **Multi-Dimensional Understanding**
   - Patterns exist in rich multi-dimensional field
   - Captures relationships beyond similarity
   - No dimensional reduction necessary

3. **Anticipatory Capabilities**
   - Predicts where new patterns might emerge
   - Identifies knowledge gaps in the field
   - Models gradients of semantic energy flow

4. **Philosophical Alignment**
   - Aligns with Habitat's core philosophy of natural pattern emergence
   - Observation rather than enforcement of relationships
   - Preserves the organic quality of semantic understanding

This approach maintains the core principles of Habitat's field-state architecture while extending it to capture richer relationship types and enable anticipatory capabilities. It represents a fundamentally different paradigm from vector-based systems, emphasizing natural emergence over forced calculation while maintaining computational efficiency.

```

## Rich Pattern Relationships

The multi-dimensional field enables recognition of diverse relationship types beyond simple similarity:

### 1. Complementary Patterns

Patterns that complete each other, creating a more comprehensive understanding when combined.

```python
class ComplementaryPatternDetector:
    def __init__(self, field_harmonics, coherence_analyzer):
        self.field_harmonics = field_harmonics
        self.coherence_analyzer = coherence_analyzer
        
    def find_complementary_pairs(self, patterns, threshold=0.6):
        """Find pattern pairs with moderate harmony and high coherence gain"""
        complementary_pairs = []
        
        for i, p1 in enumerate(patterns):
            for p2 in patterns[i+1:]:
                # Check field interaction
                interaction = self.field_harmonics.calculate_field_interaction(p1, p2)
                if not interaction:
                    continue
                    
                # Look for moderate harmony (not too similar, not too different)
                if 0.4 <= interaction['harmony'] <= 0.7:
                    # Check if combining patterns increases overall coherence
                    base_coherence = (self.coherence_analyzer.measure_semantic_coherence(p1) + 
                                     self.coherence_analyzer.measure_semantic_coherence(p2)) / 2
                    
                    combined_coherence = self.coherence_analyzer.measure_pattern_coherence(p1, p2)
                    
                    # If combined coherence is significantly higher, patterns are complementary
                    if combined_coherence > (base_coherence * (1 + threshold)):
                        complementary_pairs.append({
                            'pattern1': p1,
                            'pattern2': p2,
                            'base_coherence': base_coherence,
                            'combined_coherence': combined_coherence,
                            'improvement': combined_coherence - base_coherence
                        })
                        
        return sorted(complementary_pairs, key=lambda x: x['improvement'], reverse=True)
```

### 2. Sequential Relationships

Patterns with natural temporal or logical order.

```python
class SequentialRelationshipDetector:
    def __init__(self, field_harmonics):
        self.field_harmonics = field_harmonics
        
    def detect_sequences(self, patterns, min_sequence_length=3):
        """Detect and build sequences based on temporal or logical development"""
        sequences = []
        visited = set()
        
        for start_pattern in patterns:
            if start_pattern.id in visited:
                continue
                
            # Try to build sequence starting from this pattern
            current_sequence = [start_pattern]
            current_pattern = start_pattern
            
            while True:
                # Find next pattern in sequence
                next_pattern = self._find_next_in_sequence(current_pattern, patterns)
                if not next_pattern or next_pattern.id in visited:
                    break
                    
                current_sequence.append(next_pattern)
                visited.add(next_pattern.id)
                current_pattern = next_pattern
                
            if len(current_sequence) >= min_sequence_length:
                sequences.append({
                    'patterns': current_sequence,
                    'length': len(current_sequence),
                    'coherence': self._calculate_sequence_coherence(current_sequence)
                })
                
        return sorted(sequences, key=lambda x: x['coherence'], reverse=True)
        
    def _find_next_in_sequence(self, current_pattern, all_patterns):
        """Find the pattern that most naturally follows the current one"""
        best_next = None
        best_score = 0
        
        for pattern in all_patterns:
            if pattern.id == current_pattern.id:
                continue
                
            # Check sequential relationship strength
            score = self._check_sequential_relationship(current_pattern, pattern)
            if score > best_score:
                best_score = score
                best_next = pattern
                
        return best_next if best_score > 0.6 else None
