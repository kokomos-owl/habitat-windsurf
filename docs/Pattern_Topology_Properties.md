# Pattern Topology Properties in the Tonic-Harmonic System

## Overview

This document defines the formal properties of pattern topologies that emerge within the tonic-harmonic system. These properties provide a framework for articulating, identifying, and navigating the semantic landscape that forms through pattern co-evolution.

## Topological Properties

### 1. Frequency Domains

Frequency domains are fundamental regions of the semantic landscape characterized by their oscillation patterns:

| Property | Definition | Measurement | Functional Requirement |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Frequency Signature** | The characteristic oscillation pattern of a domain | Fourier analysis of harmonic value time series | System must detect and classify frequency signatures |
| **Bandwidth** | Range of frequencies present in a domain | Standard deviation of frequency components | System must calculate and track bandwidth changes |
| **Dominant Frequency** | Most prominent frequency in a domain | Peak in frequency spectrum | System must identify dominant frequencies for each pattern |
| **Phase Coherence** | Degree of phase alignment between oscillations | Phase coherence metric between 0-1 | System must measure phase relationships between patterns |

### 2. Boundary Characteristics

Boundaries form naturally at points of destructive interference and define the edges of semantic domains:

| Property | Definition | Measurement | Functional Requirement |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Boundary Sharpness** | Rate of change in harmonic values across boundary | Gradient magnitude at boundary points | System must quantify boundary clarity |
| **Permeability** | Ease with which patterns cross boundaries | Transition probability between domains | System must track pattern movement across boundaries |
| **Stability** | Temporal persistence of a boundary | Variance in boundary position over time | System must assess boundary stability |
| **Dimensionality** | Number of dimensions along which boundary exists | Eigenvalue analysis of boundary region | System must determine boundary dimensionality |

### 3. Resonance Points

Resonance points emerge at locations of constructive interference and represent semantic attractors:

| Property | Definition | Measurement | Functional Requirement |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Resonance Strength** | Amplitude of harmonic peak at resonance point | Peak height relative to background | System must quantify resonance intensity |
| **Attractor Basin** | Region influenced by a resonance point | Spatial extent of harmonic gradient | System must map attractor influence zones |
| **Stability** | Resistance to perturbation | Recovery time after disturbance | System must measure resonance point resilience |
| **Connectivity** | Links to other resonance points | Graph of resonance point connections | System must track resonance network topology |

### 4. Field Dynamics

The overall behavior of the semantic field emerges from pattern interactions:

| Property | Definition | Measurement | Functional Requirement |
|----------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Field Coherence** | Global organization of the field | Entropy of harmonic distribution | System must assess overall field organization |
| **Energy Flow** | Movement of harmonic energy through field | Vector field of harmonic gradients | System must track energy movement patterns |
| **Adaptation Rate** | Speed at which field responds to new patterns | Time constants of field changes | System must measure adaptation dynamics |
| **Homeostasis** | Field's ability to maintain stable state | Return time to equilibrium | System must assess field stability mechanisms |

## Implementation Requirements

To properly identify and articulate these topological properties, the system must implement:

1. **Topology Detector**: Analyzes pattern interactions to identify emergent topological features
   ```python
   class TopologyDetector:
       def detect_frequency_domains(self, pattern_history):
           # Identify regions with similar frequency characteristics
           
       def detect_boundaries(self, harmonic_landscape):
           # Locate valleys in harmonic landscape
           
       def detect_resonance_points(self, harmonic_landscape):
           # Locate peaks in harmonic landscape
           
       def analyze_field_dynamics(self, harmonic_time_series):
           # Assess overall field behavior
   ```

2. **Topology Navigator**: Provides interfaces for traversing the semantic landscape
   ```python
   class TopologyNavigator:
       def follow_gradient(self, start_point, direction):
           # Navigate along harmonic gradients
           
       def cross_boundary(self, boundary_id, direction):
           # Traverse from one domain to another
           
       def find_nearest_resonance(self, position):
           # Locate closest resonance point
           
       def map_region(self, center, radius):
           # Generate topological map of region
   ```

3. **Topology Articulator**: Translates topological properties into human-understandable form
   ```python
   class TopologyArticulator:
       def describe_position(self, position):
           # Generate description of semantic location
           
       def describe_boundary(self, boundary_id):
           # Characterize nature of boundary
           
       def describe_resonance(self, resonance_id):
           # Explain significance of resonance point
           
       def summarize_field_state(self):
           # Provide overview of current field dynamics
   ```

## Integration with Pattern Co-Evolution

These topological properties must be integrated with the pattern co-evolution system:

1. **AdaptiveID Integration**: AdaptiveIDs must be aware of their position within the topological landscape
   - Track movement through frequency domains
   - Record boundary crossings
   - Register resonance interactions

2. **PatternID Integration**: PatternIDs must understand their role in shaping topology
   - Measure contribution to boundary formation
   - Assess influence on resonance points
   - Track participation in field dynamics

3. **Learning Window Integration**: Learning windows must be topology-aware
   - Adapt behavior based on topological context
   - Prioritize changes that maintain field coherence
   - Detect when changes may disrupt important topological features

## Visualization and Navigation

The system should provide tools for visualizing and navigating the topological landscape:

1. **Topology Maps**: Visual representations of the semantic landscape
   - Frequency domain coloring
   - Boundary highlighting
   - Resonance point markers
   - Energy flow vectors

2. **Navigation Interfaces**: Methods for traversing the semantic space
   - Gradient-following navigation
   - Boundary-crossing operations
   - Resonance-seeking functions
   - Field exploration tools

3. **Topological Queries**: Ability to query the system about topological properties
   - "What boundaries exist between these patterns?"
   - "Where are the strongest resonance points?"
   - "How stable is this region of the field?"
   - "What is the dominant frequency in this domain?"

## Conclusion

By formally defining these topological properties and implementing the necessary detection, navigation, and articulation capabilities, the system can move beyond merely exhibiting topological features to actively documenting and leveraging them. This enables a richer understanding of the semantic landscape and provides powerful tools for navigating and manipulating it.

The pattern co-evolution system is not just detecting patterns; it's mapping the territory of meaning itself, revealing the natural organization that emerges from the interaction of ideas across different frequency domains.
