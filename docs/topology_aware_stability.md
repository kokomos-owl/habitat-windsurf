# Topology-Aware Stability Analysis

## Overview
The topology-aware stability analysis system monitors the evolution of vector spaces where both the vectors and their relationships are subject to change. This approach uses adaptive strategies based on window size to effectively handle both sudden semantic shifts and gradual drift.

## Dual Analysis Strategy

### Small Window Analysis (< 4 vectors)
Optimized for detecting rapid semantic shifts:
1. **Maximum Magnitude Detection**
   - Uses maximum over mean to catch sudden jumps
   - 2x multiplier for enhanced sensitivity
   - Perfect for detecting abrupt changes

2. **Direction Change Analysis**
   - Tracks orthogonal shifts in vector space
   - Combines with magnitude (70/30 weighting)
   - Non-linear response through score squaring

```python
# Small window stability calculation
magnitude_stability = 1.0 - np.clip(2.0 * max_magnitude, 0, 1)
angle_stability = mean_cosine_similarity()
stability = (0.7 * magnitude_stability + 0.3 * angle_stability) ** 2
```

### Large Window Analysis (≥ 4 vectors)
Designed for tracking gradual semantic drift:

1. **Local Topology Preservation (50%)**
   - k-nearest neighbors approach
   - Dimension-agnostic cosine similarity
   - Preserves local relationships

2. **Basis Stability (30%)**
   - Tracks principal component evolution
   - Adaptive to curved semantic spaces
   - Early warning system for drift

3. **Local Coherence (20%)**
   - Enhanced variance sensitivity (10x)
   - Scale-aware measurements
   - Pattern consistency tracking

```python
# Large window stability calculation
stability = (
    0.5 * topology_score +
    0.3 * basis_stability +
    0.2 * local_coherence
) ** 2
```

## Implementation Details

### Edge Case Handling
1. **Zero Vectors**
   - Graceful fallback for magnitude calculations
   - Safe cosine similarity computations
   - Default stability values

2. **Insufficient History**
   - Adaptive metric selection
   - Conservative stability estimates
   - Gradual metric transition

3. **Numerical Stability**
   - Bounded calculations
   - Non-zero denominators
   - Normalized intermediate values

### Performance Considerations
1. **Computational Efficiency**
   - O(n) for small windows
   - O(n²) for topology preservation
   - Lazy evaluation where possible

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Minimal state maintenance
   - Efficient structure representation
   - Smart buffer management

## Usage Guidelines

### Monitoring Thresholds
- **Small Windows**:
  - Stability < 0.5: Rapid semantic shift
  - Stability < 0.3: Critical instability
  - Monitor consecutive scores

- **Large Windows**:
  - Topology score < 0.7: Structure breakdown
  - Basis drift > 0.3: Semantic drift
  - Local coherence < 0.5: Pattern instability

### System Response
1. **Automatic Adjustments**
   - Learning rate adaptation
   - Window size modification
   - Metric weight updates

2. **Alerting**
   - Progressive warning levels
   - Context-aware thresholds
   - Trend analysis

## Future Enhancements

1. **Adaptive Mechanisms**
   - Dynamic window sizing
   - Auto-tuning parameters
   - Context-sensitive metrics

2. **Extended Analysis**
   - Persistent homology
   - Information geometry
   - Entropy measures

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel computation
   - Approximate methods
   - Incremental updates

## Implementation Notes
- Different metrics for different scales
- Emphasis on structural changes
- Non-linear response to instability
- Dimension-agnostic measurements
- Graceful edge case handling

The dual approach effectively balances the need to detect both sudden semantic shifts and gradual drift while maintaining numerical stability and computational efficiency.
