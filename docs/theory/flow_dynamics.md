# Flow Dynamics and Pattern Dissipation

## Overview

This document describes the theoretical foundations and implementation details of flow dynamics in our pattern evolution system, particularly focusing on how patterns dissipate and interact through phase relationships.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Pattern Flow Dynamics

#### 1.1 Viscosity
- **Base Viscosity**: Inversely proportional to coherence
- **Modifiers**:
  - Stability reduces viscosity by up to 50%
  - Energy state reduces viscosity by up to 30%
  - Incoherent patterns (coherence ≤ 0.3) have 50% higher viscosity

#### 1.2 Phase Relationships
- Phase difference (φ) quantifies conceptual distance
- Phase factor = 0.5 + 0.5 * cos(φ)
- Correlation decays exponentially with distance: exp(-d/coherence_length)

### 2. Pattern States

#### 2.1 Core Patterns
- Coherence ≥ 0.8
- Minimal noise (0.1)
- Perfect persistence (1.0)
- Serve as conceptual anchors

#### 2.2 Satellite Patterns
- Coherence inherited through phase relationships
- Strength decays with phase difference
- Maintain stability through core pattern relationships

#### 2.3 Incoherent Patterns
- Coherence ≤ 0.3
- High viscosity promotes dissipation
- Weak persistence and reproducibility

## Implementation Details

### 1. Flow Metrics

```python
@dataclass
class FlowMetrics:
    viscosity: float    # Resistance to pattern propagation
    back_pressure: float # Counter-forces to emergence
    volume: float       # Pattern instance quantity
    current: float      # Flow direction and rate
```

### 2. Signal Quality

```python
@dataclass
class SignalMetrics:
    strength: float      # Pattern signal clarity
    noise_ratio: float   # Signal noise level
    persistence: float   # Pattern integrity over time
    reproducibility: float # Pattern consistency
```

## Pattern Evolution Rules

### 1. Coherence Propagation
- Core patterns maintain maximum coherence (1.0)
- Satellite patterns inherit scaled coherence through phase relationships
- Coherence decay follows wave mechanics principles

### 2. Dissipation Mechanics
- High viscosity reduces coherence and energy
- Incoherent patterns experience accelerated dissipation
- Phase relationships influence dissipation rates

### 3. Flow Effects
- Patterns flow from high to low coherence regions
- Back pressure resists pattern emergence
- Volume affects pattern stability and influence

## Analysis Modes

### 1. COHERENCE Mode
- Basic pattern relationship analysis
- Coherence threshold: 0.6
- Noise threshold: 0.3

### 2. WAVE Mode
- Phase relationship analysis
- Wave mechanics parameters
- Group and phase velocity tracking

### 3. FLOW Mode
- Viscosity and dissipation effects
- Turbulence detection
- Flow direction analysis

### 4. INFORMATION Mode
- Information theory metrics

## Future Directions

### 1. Enhanced Flow Dynamics
