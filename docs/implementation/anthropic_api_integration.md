# Anthropic API Integration

## Overview

This document details the integration of the Anthropic API into the Habitat Evolution system, specifically focusing on the Claude adapter implementation and how it enhances the system's pattern extraction and analysis capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### ClaudeAdapter

The `ClaudeAdapter` class has been updated to integrate with the Anthropic API, providing a bridge between the Habitat Evolution system and Claude's advanced language capabilities. The adapter:

- Uses the Anthropic Python SDK to communicate with the Claude API
- Falls back to a robust mock implementation when no API key is available
- Processes queries and documents with appropriate prompts and context
- Returns standardized response structures for both real and mock implementations

### Key Features

1. **API Key Management**
   - Uses the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable for secure API access
   - Automatically detects whether to use the real API or mock implementation

2. **Query Processing**
   - Formats patterns and context for effective Claude prompts
   - Uses the Claude 3 Opus model for optimal performance
   - Includes proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

3. **Document Processing**
   - Extracts patterns from documents using Claude's understanding
   - Formats patterns with appropriate quality states and evidence

4. **Response Standardization**
   - Includes query IDs, timestamps, and token usage metrics
   - Maintains consistent structure between real and mock implementations

## Integration with Services

The updated `ClaudeAdapter` is used by several key services in the Habitat Evolution system:

1. **ClaudeBaselineService**
   - Provides minimal baseline enhancement to queries
   - Uses Claude to enhance queries without projecting patterns

2. **EnhancedClaudeBaselineService**
   - Extends the baseline service with dissonance detection
   - Leverages Claude for more sophisticated pattern analysis

## Testing

A test script (`test_claude_adapter.py`) has been created to verify the integration:

```python
# Test script for verifying Claude API integration
# Located at: /Users/prphillips/Documents/GitHub/habitat_alpha/src/habitat_evolution/test_claude_adapter.py
```

The test confirms that:

- The API key is properly set in the environment
- The ClaudeAdapter can initialize the Anthropic client
- Queries can be successfully processed through the API
- Responses are well-formed and contain the expected information

## Benefits

This integration significantly enhances the Habitat Evolution system's capabilities:

1. **Improved Pattern Extraction**: Claude's advanced understanding enables more nuanced pattern identification
2. **Enhanced Query Processing**: More contextually relevant responses to user queries
3. **Better Dissonance Detection**: More accurate identification of constructive dissonance
4. **Robust Testing Support**: Mock implementation ensures testing can proceed without API access

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the Anthropic API integration include:

1. Implementing streaming responses for real-time pattern extraction
2. Adding support for different Claude models based on task requirements
3. Enhancing prompt engineering for more specialized pattern identification
4. Implementing caching mechanisms to reduce API usage and costs
