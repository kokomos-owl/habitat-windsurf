# System Health Components

## Core Concepts

### 1. Tonic and Pulse Pattern
The system maintains a baseline state (tonic) and tracks rhythmic patterns (pulse) over time:

- **Tonic**: Baseline system state
  - Uses exponential moving average for smooth transitions
  - Adapts to system evolution over time
  - Provides reference point for deviation detection

- **Pulse**: Rhythmic patterns in system behavior
  - Tracks temporal sequences of observations
  - Detects basic rhythm types (ascending, descending, oscillating)
  - Maintains sliding window of recent pulses

### 2. Cross-Dimensional Resonance
System health emerges from interactions between dimensions:

- **Window States**:
  - CLOSED → OPENING → OPEN → CLOSING
  - Each state transition carries boundary tension metrics
  - Cross-threshold observations indicate dimensional interaction

- **Resonance Detection**:
  - Tracks active dimensions
  - Measures cross-dimensional harmony
  - Identifies emergent patterns across boundaries

### 3. Health Metrics

#### Metric Types
1. **Tonic (Baseline)**
   - System equilibrium state
   - Long-term stability indicators
   - Adaptive baseline evolution

2. **Pulse (Rhythm)**
   - Regular behavioral patterns
   - Temporal sequence analysis
   - Pattern deviation tracking

3. **Resonance (Harmony)**
   - Cross-dimensional coherence
   - Pattern synchronization
   - System-wide harmony metrics

4. **Tension (Stress)**
   - System stress indicators
   - Boundary pressure metrics
   - Threshold violation tracking

#### Implementation
```python
class HealthMetricType(Enum):
    TONIC = "tonic"          # Baseline system state
    PULSE = "pulse"          # Regular rhythmic patterns
    RESONANCE = "resonance"  # Cross-dimensional harmony
    TENSION = "tension"      # System stress indicators
```

### 4. Pattern Evolution

#### Observation Recording
- Chronological tracking of all observations
- Preservation of complete evolution history
- Dimensional patterns and states
- Weight updates for each observation

#### Natural Pattern Emergence
- Patterns emerge without forced relationships
- Boundary tension mechanics guide evolution
- Dimension weights adapt based on observation frequency
- System-level patterns form organically

### 5. Health History

#### Storage Components
1. **Snapshots**
   - System health state at a point in time
   - Complete metric set for all dimensions
   - Cross-dimensional relationships
   - Active patterns and their states

2. **Transitions**
   - Health state changes over time
   - Transition metrics and pressure levels
   - Pattern evolution records
   - Dimensional state changes

#### Visualization Integration
- Neo4j graph representation
- NetworkX compatibility for analysis
- JSON persistence for history
- Rich metric visualization

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize health service
health_service = SystemHealthService(history_dir="./health_history")

# Record observation
health_report = health_service.observe({
    "severity": 0.7,
    "dimensions": {
        "temporal": {"window_state": "OPEN"},
        "spatial": {"window_state": "OPENING"}
    }
})

# Health report contains:
{
    'timestamp': datetime.now(),
    'current_status': {
        'system_stress': 0.7,
        'temporal_tension': 0.4,
        'spatial_tension': 0.6
    },
    'rhythm_patterns': {
        'system_stress': {
            'tonic': 0.65,
            'variance': 0.02,
            'rhythm': {'type': 'oscillating'}
        }
    },
    'resonance_levels': {
        'cross_dimensional': 0.8
    }
}
```
