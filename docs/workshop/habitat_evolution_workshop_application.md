## About the Workshop

The Habitat Evolution Workshop is a comprehensive 10-week program designed to equip participants with the knowledge and skills to build climate-focused AI applications using the Habitat Evolution framework, Windsurf database, and PydanticAI. This workshop is suitable for researchers, developers, analysts, and decision-makers interested in leveraging AI for climate risk assessment and adaptation planning.

Participants will learn how to detect, analyze, and evolve patterns across both textual and statistical climate data, build cross-modal pattern analysis applications, and develop practical solutions for climate challenges.

## Learning Paths

We offer three learning paths to accommodate different backgrounds and goals:

1. **User Path:** For those who want to use existing Habitat components with minimal programming. Focus on application and integration.

2. **Analyst Path:** For those interested in pattern analysis and interpretation. Focus on extracting insights from climate data with moderate programming.

3. **Builder Path:** For developers who want to extend and customize Habitat. Focus on component development and integration with advanced programming.
