## Strengths to Leverage

- **Philosophical Clarity**: The system now has a clear philosophical foundation based on natural emergence and field observation
- **Reduced Dependencies**: By removing vector store dependencies, Habitat is more self-contained and efficient
- **Functional Organization**: System components have clearly labeled functions, improving maintenance and understanding

## Development Approach

The revised schematic provides a solid foundation for this next phase of development, with clear function labels and component relationships that align with Habitat's vision as an efficient "interface of interfaces." Development should proceed with these principles in mind:

1. **Natural emergence over forced calculation**: Allow patterns and relationships to form through observation of field states
2. **Scalar measurements over vector operations**: Use field properties and scalar metrics instead of vector computations
3. **Light-touch semantic relationships**: Employ temporal alignment and tonic-harmonic measures instead of vector similarity
4. **Computational efficiency**: Maintain minimal computational footprint appropriate for an interface of interfaces
