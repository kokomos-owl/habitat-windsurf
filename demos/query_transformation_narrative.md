# Query as Actant: Transformation Narrative

This document describes how queries function as first-class actants in the semantic ecosystem, evolving and transforming as they journey through different domains.

## Modality-Agnostic Knowledge Representation

The Habitat Pattern Language framework enables a modality-agnostic approach to knowledge representation, where semantic patterns can be preserved across different representations. Queries, as actants, demonstrate this capability by maintaining their semantic identity while transforming across domains.

## Queries as Creative Relationships

Queries represent creative relationships between habitat, human, and intelligent agents. They are not merely information retrieval mechanisms but active participants in the semantic ecosystem, capable of evolution and transformation.

## Query Transformation Stories

### query_001: What are the economic impacts of sea level rise?

**Initial Context:** climate_risk

**Focus:** economic_impact

**Initial Confidence:** 0.8

#### Pattern Propensities

- Coherence: 0.7699999999999999

- Capaciousness: 0.44

#### Directionality

- expansion: 0.5

- contraction: 0.5

- stability: 0.8666666666666667

- volatility: 0.1333333333333333

#### Transformation Journey

The query begins in the economic_impact domain as a analyst.

#### Semantic Evolution

**Final Confidence:** 0.80

**Final Uncertainty:** 0.30

As the query journeyed through domains, its confidence remained stable, suggesting that the semantic ecosystem maintained the integrity of the original query intent.

### query_002: What policy responses address coastal flooding?

**Initial Context:** adaptation

**Focus:** policy_response

**Initial Confidence:** 0.7

#### Pattern Propensities

- Coherence: 0.7

- Capaciousness: 0.44

#### Directionality

- expansion: 0.5

- contraction: 0.5

- stability: 0.8666666666666667

- volatility: 0.1333333333333333

#### Transformation Journey

The query begins in the policy_response domain as a advisor.

#### Semantic Evolution

**Final Confidence:** 0.70

**Final Uncertainty:** 0.30

As the query journeyed through domains, its confidence remained stable, suggesting that the semantic ecosystem maintained the integrity of the original query intent.

### query_003: How do sea level rise and economic impacts influence policy?

**Initial Context:** decision_making

**Focus:** integrated_analysis

**Initial Confidence:** 0.6

#### Pattern Propensities

- Coherence: 0.79

- Capaciousness: 0.5

#### Directionality

- expansion: 0.5

- contraction: 0.5

- stability: 0.9

- volatility: 0.1

#### Transformation Journey

The query begins in the economic_impact domain as a analyst.

Then, it moves to the policy_response domain as a advisor.

Then, it moves to the sea_level_rise domain as a explorer.

#### Role Transformations

- Transformed from analyst to advisor when moving from economic_impact to policy_response.

- Transformed from advisor to explorer when moving from policy_response to sea_level_rise.

#### Semantic Evolution

**Final Confidence:** 0.70

**Final Uncertainty:** 0.20

As the query journeyed through domains, its confidence increased by 0.10, indicating that the semantic ecosystem provided clarity and refinement to the original query.

The query's uncertainty decreased as it interacted with domain knowledge, resulting in a more focused and precise semantic representation.

## Conclusion: Queries as First-Class Actants

This demonstration shows how queries can function as first-class actants in the semantic ecosystem, with their own identities, journeys, and transformations. By treating queries as actants, we enable a more dynamic and interactive knowledge representation system, where queries are not just static information retrieval mechanisms but active participants in the co-evolution of semantic patterns.


The modality-agnostic nature of the Habitat Pattern Language framework allows these query actants to maintain their semantic identity across different representations and domains, demonstrating the power of pattern-based knowledge representation in creating a more flexible and adaptive semantic ecosystem.
