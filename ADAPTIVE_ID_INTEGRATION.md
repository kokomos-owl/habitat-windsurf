# AdaptiveID Integration with Learning Windows

## Overview

This document outlines the integration strategy for combining the AdaptiveID system with the Learning Windows architecture in the Pattern-Aware RAG system. The integration enables controlled pattern evolution while maintaining stability and coherence across both persistent and non-persistent operational modes.

## Core Components

### 1. Event Coordination

The `EventCoordinator` serves as the central integration point:

```python
class EventCoordinator:
    def __init__(self, max_queue_size: int = 1000):
        self.event_queue = deque(maxlen=max_queue_size)
        self.current_window: Optional[LearningWindow] = None
        self.back_pressure = BackPressureController()
        self.stability_scores: List[float] = []
```

Key responsibilities:
- Manages event flow between components
- Controls back pressure based on stability
- Tracks window state and transitions
- Coordinates pattern evolution

### 2. Pattern Evolution Flow

The pattern evolution process follows this sequence:

```
Event Received
    ↓
Window State Check
    ↓
Back Pressure Applied
    ↓
Pattern Evolution
    ↓
State Transition
```

### 3. Dual-Mode Operation

The system supports two operational modes:

#### a) Neo4j Persistence Mode
- Full pattern history in Neo4j
- Complete provenance tracking
- Graph-based relationships
- Complex pattern queries

#### b) Direct LLM Mode
- In-memory pattern tracking
- Fast pattern processing
- Minimal persistence overhead
- Trust-based operation

## Integration Points

### 1. Window Lifecycle Management

```python
class LearningWindow:
    def state(self) -> WindowState:
        """Window states follow:
        1. CLOSED (initial)
        2. OPENING (first minute)
        3. OPEN (after first minute)
        4. CLOSED (when saturated/expired)
        """
```

### 2. Pattern State Management

```python
class AdaptiveId:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize contexts following standard pattern
        self.temporal_context = json.dumps({})
        self.spatial_context = None
        self._connected_patterns: Set[str] = set()
```

### 3. Stability Control

```python
class BackPressureController:
    def calculate_delay(self, stability_score: float) -> float:
        """Models system like a tree responding to stress:
        - Stability drops create mechanical stress
        - System develops memory of stress patterns
        - Response strengthens in repeated stress areas
        """
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Event Processing

a) Queue events through EventCoordinator:
```python
coordinator.queue_event(
    event_type="pattern_update",
    entity_id=pattern.id,
    data=pattern_data,
    stability_score=current_stability
)
```

b) Handle window transitions:
```python
if window.transition_if_needed():
    coordinator.handle_transition(window.state)
```

### 2. Pattern Evolution

a) Track relationships:
```python
pattern.connect_pattern(
    pattern_id=related.id,
    relationship_strength=strength,
    pattern_type=rel_type
)
```

b) Manage contexts:
```python
pattern.update_temporal_context({
    "window_state": window.state,
    "stability": stability_score
})
```

### 3. Error Handling

a) Validate state transitions:
```python
if not window.is_active:
    raise ValueError("No active learning window")
if window.is_saturated:
    raise ValueError("Learning window is saturated")
```

b) Track stability issues:
```python
if stability_score < window.stability_threshold:
    coordinator.handle_stability_warning()
```

## Testing Strategy

1. Window Lifecycle Tests:
- State transitions
- Saturation handling
- Event coordination

2. Pattern Evolution Tests:
- Relationship tracking
- Context management
- ID persistence

3. Integration Tests:
- End-to-end flow
- Stability control
- Error handling

## Best Practices

1. Pattern Management:
- Use EventCoordinator for all pattern updates
- Track stability consistently
- Handle both persistence modes

2. Window Control:
- Monitor saturation levels
- Respect stability thresholds
- Handle transitions cleanly

3. Error Handling:
- Validate state before updates
- Track stability warnings
- Maintain clean error states

## Next Steps

1. Implementation Phase:
- Integrate EventCoordinator
- Implement dual-mode support
- Add stability tracking

2. Testing Phase:
- Add integration tests
- Validate dual-mode operation
- Test stability control

3. Deployment Phase:
- Monitor stability metrics
- Track pattern evolution
- Validate persistence
