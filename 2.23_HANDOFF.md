## Handoff Notes

The system has achieved a significant milestone with the successful validation of the climate risk pattern system. The Neo4j integration is working as expected, with proper probability modeling and context preservation. The next team should focus on completing the Ghost toolbar integration and enhancing the pattern analysis capabilities.

Key areas to maintain:
1. Probability accuracy in pattern modeling
2. Spatial-temporal context preservation
3. Graph relationship integrity
4. Test coverage for new features

Remember to run the full test suite before making any significant changes:
```bash
python3 -m pytest src/habitat_evolution/tests/visualization/test_semantic_pattern_visualization.py -v
```

## Success Metrics
- All tests passing
- Correct probability values in Neo4j
- Proper context preservation
- Accurate relationship modeling

This handoff document represents the state of the system as of February 22, 2025. Please refer to the documentation and contact the appropriate team members for detailed questions about specific components.
