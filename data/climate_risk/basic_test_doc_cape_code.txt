Climate Risk Assessment - Cape Cod, MA

Basic Assessment Document

Introduction
This assessment examines key climate risks for Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The analysis focuses on primary hazards affecting the region over the next few decades.

Results Summary
Cape Cod faces increasing risks from sea level rise, coastal flooding, and erosion. Current projections indicate accelerating impacts through mid-century, with substantial uncertainty in late-century estimates.

Key Hazards

Sea Level Rise
Current trends show sea level rising at 3mm per year along Cape Cod's coast. Mid-century projections indicate:
- 0.5-1.0 feet of rise by 2050
- Increased coastal flooding frequency
- Enhanced erosion of barrier beaches

Coastal Flooding
Storm surge flooding presents increasing risks:
- Current 100-year flood zones expanding
- More frequent moderate flooding events
- Infrastructure vulnerability in low-lying areas

Coastal Erosion
Shoreline change analysis indicates:
- Average erosion rates of 2-3 feet per year
- Accelerating loss at coastal hotspots
- Barrier beach system vulnerability

Time Horizons
- Present (2020-2030): Established trends continuing
- Mid-century (2040-2060): Accelerating impacts
- Late-century: Increasing uncertainty in projections

Confidence Levels
- High confidence in current trends
- Medium confidence in mid-century projections
- Lower confidence in late-century estimates
