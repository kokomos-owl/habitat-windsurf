  "analysis": "Based on the provided climate risk patterns, here are some relevant named entity types for a climate risk NER system:\n\n1. CLIMATE_HAZARD\n   - Represents specific climate-related hazards or threats\n   - Examples: sea level rise, coastal flooding, erosion, extreme precipitation, drought, wildfires, storms\n   - Patterns: often capitalized, may be followed by terms like \"risk\", \"impact\", \"threat\", or \"danger\"\n\n2. CLIMATE_IMPACT\n   - Represents the consequences or effects of climate hazards on natural or human systems  \n   - Examples: coastal erosion, infrastructure damage, habitat loss, system transformation\n   - Patterns: often follows mentions of CLIMATE_HAZARDs, may include terms like \"impact\", \"consequence\", \"effect\", \"result\"\n\n3. TEMPORAL_REFERENCE\n   - Represents mentions of specific time periods or temporal horizons in the context of climate change\n   - Examples: near-term, mid-century, late-century, by 2100, 1970-1990, 2010-2020\n   - Patterns: includes explicit date ranges, terms like \"century\", \"term\", or \"horizon\", may follow \"by\" or \"in\"\n\n4. LOCATION\n   - Represents specific geographic locations or regions \n   - Examples: Nantucket Sound, Martha's Vineyard, Cape Cod, Northeast U.S.\n   - Patterns: capitalized place names, may be followed by \"region\", \"area\", etc.\n\n5. SYSTEM_COMPONENT  \n   - Represents specific natural or human systems impacted by climate change\n   - Examples: coastal roads, power stations, water treatment facilities, barrier beaches, marine ecosystems\n   - Patterns: often multi-word terms, may be preceded by adjectives like \"natural\", \"infrastructure\", \"ecological\"\n\n6. ADAPTATION_STRATEGY\n   - Represents specific strategies or measures to adapt to climate change impacts\n   - Examples: less common, but could be extracted from \"Interconnected adaptation strategies\" section\n   - Patterns: may include terms like \"adaptation\", \"strategy\", \"measure\", or \"action\"\n\n7. EVIDENCE_TYPE\n   - Represents specific types of evidence used to characterize climate risks and impacts  \n   - Examples: quantitative data, qualitative inputs, primary data, secondary research, expert knowledge\n   - Patterns: often preceded by adjectives like \"quantitative\" or \"qualitative\", may include \"evidence\", \"data\", \"knowledge\"\n\n8. RELATIONSHIP_TYPE  \n   - Represents types of relationships or interactions between climate system components\n   - Examples: impact cascades, feedback loops, interconnected risks, environmental interactions\n   - Patterns: often multi-word, descriptive terms, may include \"relationship\", \"interaction\", \"connection\"",
