By 2070\u20132090, the historical 100-year event will become a roughly 1-in-20 year event for all of Martha's Vineyard.",

A more drastic uptick is anticipated toward the end of the century (2071\u20132090), where the probability of annual occurrence will be around 26%, an increase of 17% relative to 2001\u20132020.",

      "evidence": "By mid-century (2040\u20132060), Martha's Vineyard can expect an average additional eight wildfire danger days per year, representing a 44% increase over the historical annual average of 18 days. By late-century (2070\u20132090), the island can expect to experience an average additional 17 wildfire danger days per year compared to 2000\u20132020, a 94% increase over the historical annual average.",

      "evidence": "However, future increases in storm tides due to changes in storm tracks in the New England region are less certain (Pringle et al., 2021). This is due to the overall area having a larger tidal range, and the timing of the storms impacting the eastern seaboard of the U.S.",
