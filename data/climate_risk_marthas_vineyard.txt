CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT â€“ MARTHA'S VINEYARD

SUMMARY
Martha's Vineyard faces significant climate risks including sea level rise, increased storm intensity, and changing precipitation patterns. By 2050, sea levels are projected to rise by 1.5 to 3.1 feet, threatening coastal properties and infrastructure. The island has experienced extreme drought between 12% and 15% of the time in recent years. The number of wildfire days is expected to increase 40% by mid-century and 70% by late-century.

KEY RISKS

1. Sea Level Rise
   - Projected rise of 1.5 to 3.1 feet by 2050
   - Up to 6.5 feet by 2100 under high emissions scenarios
   - Increased coastal erosion affecting 30% of shoreline
   - Saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers

2. Extreme Weather Events
   - 25% increase in hurricane intensity
   - 15% increase in winter storm frequency
   - Storm surge amplification due to sea level rise
   - Infrastructure damage estimated at $120M by 2050

3. Drought Conditions
   - Experienced extreme drought between 12% and 15% of the time
   - Agricultural impacts affecting local food production
   - Increased water scarcity during summer months
   - Groundwater depletion concerns

4. Wildfire Risk
   - Number of wildfire days is expected to increase 40% by mid-century and 70% by late-century
   - Extended dry seasons increasing combustible vegetation
   - Limited evacuation routes from the island
   - Impacts on tourism and local economy

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Coastal Adaptation
   - Implement coastal buffer zones to mitigate flooding risks
   - Beach nourishment and dune restoration programs
   - Elevation of critical infrastructure
   - Managed retreat from highest-risk areas

2. Water Resource Management
   - Develop drought management plans for agriculture and water resources
   - Rainwater harvesting and greywater systems
   - Desalination feasibility assessment
   - Water conservation education programs

3. Fire Prevention and Response
   - Enhance wildfire prevention and response capabilities
   - Vegetation management in wildland-urban interface
   - Improved early warning systems
   - Community evacuation planning

4. Infrastructure Resilience
   - Improve storm resilience for critical infrastructure
   - Microgrid development with renewable energy
   - Transportation network upgrades
   - Communications redundancy planning
