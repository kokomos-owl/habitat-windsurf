# Habitat Learning Windows

## Overview

Habitat Learning Windows provide a temporal framework for pattern evolution and emergence in the Pattern-Aware RAG system. The system integrates AdaptiveID with learning windows through a sophisticated event-driven architecture that manages pattern coherence, evolution, and relationships.

## Core Components

### 1. AdaptiveID Integration

The learning window system integrates directly with AdaptiveID through:

- **Temporal Context Management**
  - Pattern versioning and relationships
  - Thread-safe context tracking
  - State persistence options (Neo4j/Direct)

- **Pattern Identity Flow**
```
Pattern Creation -> Context Attachment -> Evolution Tracking -> State Updates
       ↓                    ↓                    ↓                 ↓
   Base Pattern      Temporal Context     Relationship Graph    Quality
   Definition        Management           Updates              Assessment
```

### 2. Window States and Transitions

```
CLOSED -> OPENING -> OPEN -> CLOSED
```

Each state serves a specific purpose in pattern evolution:

- **CLOSED**
  - Initial state
  - No pattern changes accepted
  - Triggered by: low density, saturation, expiration
  - Maintains system stability

- **OPENING**
  - Pattern observation phase
  - First minute of window lifecycle
  - Builds coherence metrics
  - Establishes baseline stability

- **OPEN**
  - Active learning phase
  - Pattern evolution enabled
  - Quality metrics tracking
  - Back pressure management

### 3. Pattern Metrics and Quality

#### A. Core Pattern Metrics
```python
PatternMetrics(
    coherence=1.0,        # Pattern internal consistency
    emergence_rate=0.8,   # Rate of pattern development
    cross_pattern_flow=0.0, # Inter-pattern influence
    energy_state=0.8,     # Pattern energy level
    adaptation_rate=0.0,  # Change responsiveness
    stability=0.9         # Overall stability
)
```

#### B. Field Gradients
```python
field_gradients = {
    "coherence": 1.0,    # Pattern coherence field
    "energy": 0.8,       # Energy distribution
    "density": 1.0,      # Pattern density
    "turbulence": 0.0    # Field instability
}
```

#### C. Quality Assessment
```python
quality = {
    "signal": {
        "strength": 1.0,
        "noise_ratio": 0.1,
        "persistence": 0.9,
        "reproducibility": 0.9
    },
    "flow": {
        "viscosity": 0.2,
        "back_pressure": 0.0,
        "volume": 0.0,
        "current": 0.0
    }
}
```

### 4. Event System Integration

#### A. Core Services
- **PatternEvolutionService**: Manages pattern lifecycle
- **FieldStateService**: Handles field transitions
- **GradientService**: Calculates field gradients
- **FlowDynamicsService**: Manages pattern flow
- **MetricsService**: Computes core metrics
- **QualityMetricsService**: Analyzes quality
- **EventManagementService**: Coordinates events

#### B. Event Processing Flow
```
Event -> Back Pressure Check -> Window Validation -> Pattern Processing
  ↑             ↓                     ↓                    ↓
  └─── Delay Calculation ← Stability Assessment ← Pattern Evolution
```

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Window Creation and Management

```python
# Create a learning window with appropriate parameters
window = event_coordinator.create_learning_window(
    duration_minutes=30,
    stability_threshold=0.7,  # Minimum stability for normal operation
    coherence_threshold=0.6,  # Minimum pattern coherence
    max_changes=50           # Maximum changes before saturation
)

# Monitor window state
stats = event_coordinator.get_window_stats()
if stats["is_saturated"]:
    # Handle window saturation
    await handle_window_transition()
```

### 2. Pattern Processing

```python
# Process patterns within window constraints
async def process_with_patterns(self, query: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> RAGResponse:
    # Get current field state
    field_state = await self.field_state.get_field_state(context.get("field_id"))
    
    # Calculate gradients
    gradients = await self.gradient.calculate_gradient(
        field_state.id,
        context.get("position")
    )
    
    # Calculate flow metrics
    flow_metrics = await self.flow_dynamics.calculate_flow(
        gradients,
        context.get("pattern"),
        context.get("related_patterns", [])
    )
    
    # Update pattern state if window is open
    if self.current_window.state == WindowState.OPEN:
        await self.pattern_evolution.update_pattern_state(
            pattern_id=context["pattern"]["id"],
            new_state={
                "quality": quality_metrics,
                "flow": flow_metrics,
                "gradients": gradients
            }
        )
```

## Testing Framework

### 1. Integration Testing
```python
def test_pattern_coherence_detection(self):
    """Test pattern coherence through multiple lenses:
    1. Wave Mechanics
    2. Field Theory
    3. Information Theory
    4. Quantum Analogs
    5. Flow Dynamics
    """
    # Test implementation
```

### 2. Window Lifecycle Tests
```python
def test_window_lifecycle(self):
    """Validate window state transitions and metrics"""
    window = create_test_window()
    
    # Test CLOSED -> OPENING
    assert window.state == WindowState.CLOSED
    window.open()
    assert window.state == WindowState.OPENING
    
    # Test pattern processing
    for pattern in test_patterns:
        window.process_pattern(pattern)
        assert window.metrics.coherence >= 0.6
```

## Best Practices

1. **Pattern Management**
   - Track coherence continuously
   - Monitor cross-pattern influence
   - Maintain relationship graphs
   - Handle emergence gracefully

2. **Window Control**
   - Respect back pressure signals
   - Monitor saturation levels
   - Handle transitions atomically
   - Maintain event ordering

3. **Error Handling**
   - Validate state transitions
   - Handle saturation gracefully
   - Manage concurrent updates
   - Track error patterns

4. **Performance**
   - Use appropriate window sizes
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Optimize event processing
   - Handle concurrent patterns

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Back Pressure Management

The system uses a sophisticated back pressure mechanism:
- Increases delay with decreasing stability
- Responds to window saturation
- Manages coherence thresholds
- Controls event timing

### 2. Pattern Coherence Detection

Multiple analysis methods:
- Wave mechanics analysis
- Field theory gradients
- Information flow tracking
- Quantum analog modeling
- Flow dynamics assessment

### 3. Scaling Considerations

For large-scale deployments:
- Distributed pattern tracking
- Multi-window coordination
- Cross-pattern relationships
- Event propagation control
