# Habitat Evolution Development Handoff (March 26, 2025)

## Project Overview

Habitat Evolution is built on the principles of pattern evolution and co-evolution, designed to detect and evolve coherent patterns while enabling the observation of semantic change across the system. The current focus is on integrating dynamic pattern detection with learning windows, gradients, and vector+ tonic-harmonics for semantic boundary detection.

### Core Philosophy

The system follows these key principles:

1. **Emergent Patterns**: Patterns emerge naturally from observations rather than being predefined
2. **Co-evolution**: Patterns evolve through interaction with each other and the semantic field
3. **Field Awareness**: Pattern detection respects the underlying semantic field structure
4. **Tonic-Harmonic Approach**: Uses musical harmony concepts to detect semantic boundaries

### Key Technical Concepts

- **AdaptiveID**: Provides versioning, relationship tracking, and state change notifications
- **Learning Windows**: Temporal windows that control when pattern evolution can occur
- **Back Pressure**: Regulates the rate of pattern detection to ensure system stability
- **Tonic-Harmonics**: Analyzes pattern relationships using concepts from musical harmony
- **Vector+**: Enhances traditional vector embeddings with harmonic resonance properties

### Current Focus: Meta-Pattern Feedback Loop and Topology Metrics Integration âœ…

#### Key Architectural Insights (March 27, 2025)

- **Window State Architecture**:
  - The OPENING state serves as a critical "soak period" between detecting favorable field conditions and committing to pattern detection
  - Implemented adaptive soak periods based on field coherence and stability
  - Enhanced: Now using the OPENING period to warm vector caches and adjust detection thresholds based on emerging field metrics

- **Back Pressure Mechanism**:
  - Functions as a rate limiter when the window is OPEN
  - Controls frequency of pattern detection rather than binary allow/block
  - Adapts based on detection history and field stability
  - Test improvements demonstrate the multi-layered protection architecture (window state + back pressure)

- **Meta-Pattern Feedback Loop**:
  - Implemented detection of higher-order patterns (meta-patterns) across different types:
    - Object Evolution: Patterns showing how objects evolve over time
    - Causal Cascade: Patterns showing cause-effect relationships that cascade
    - Convergent Influence: Patterns showing multiple influences converging
  - Created dynamic parameter adjustment based on pattern type, confidence, and frequency
  - Different pattern types trigger specialized adjustment strategies for optimal detection

- **Topology Metrics Extraction**:
  - Implemented extraction of rich topology metrics from field gradients
  - Metrics include: resonance centers, interference patterns, field density centers, flow vectors
  - Added calculation of derived metrics: resonance density, interference complexity, flow coherence
  - Structured metrics for easy visualization of field state and pattern evolution

### Debugging Tips

- If you encounter import errors, check the import paths in the affected files
- For database connection errors, consider creating mock objects for testing

- For field state issues, ensure the TonicHarmonicFieldState is properly initialized with eigenvalues
- Monitor the event bus to ensure events are being published and subscribed to correctly
