# Habitat Test Plan

**Document Date**: 2025-02-16
**Status**: In Progress 🚧

## Overview

This document outlines the remaining test implementation plan for Habitat, focusing on Pattern-Aware RAG integration, system stability, and end-to-end validation.

## 1. Pattern-Aware RAG Tests 🟡

### Graph State Foundation (`test_pattern_processing.py`)

#### Validation Patterns
The Pattern-Aware RAG system implements a two-level validation hierarchy to ensure data integrity:

1. **Semantic Validation** (During Initialization)
   - Relations must have non-empty types and non-negative weights
   - Pattern confidence must be above threshold (0.5)
   - Node IDs must be non-empty
   - Ensures invalid data is caught immediately during object creation

2. **Structural Validation** (During `validate_relations`)
   - State cannot be empty (no nodes, patterns, or relations)
   - Required components must exist (nodes and patterns)
   - Relations must reference valid nodes or patterns
   - Allows flexibility in when to check structural requirements

This separation of concerns allows partial states during construction while maintaining data integrity.

#### Test Coverage
- [x] Initial state loading
  - Verify correct initialization of graph state
  - Validate state persistence
  - Test error handling for invalid states
- [x] Prompt formation
  - Test dynamic prompt construction
  - Verify context integration
  - Validate prompt templates
- [x] State agreement process
  - Test consensus mechanisms with temporal decay
  - Verify state synchronization with version control
  - Validate conflict resolution with multi-state merging

### Learning Window Control (`test_learning_window_control.py`)
- [ ] State transitions
  - Test CLOSED → OPENING transition
  - Test OPENING → OPEN transition
  - Verify state persistence
  - Validate transition conditions
- [ ] Back pressure control
  - Test overload detection
  - Verify throttling mechanisms
  - Validate recovery procedures
- [ ] Coherence maintenance
  - Test stability metrics
  - Verify coherence thresholds
  - Validate adaptation mechanisms

### Integration Tests (`test_full_cycle.py`)
- [ ] Claude interaction
  - Test API integration
  - Verify response handling
  - Validate error scenarios
- [ ] Full state cycle verification
  - Test complete pattern lifecycle
  - Verify state transitions
  - Validate event handling

## Supporting Tests

### Coherence Validation (`test_coherence_interface.py`)
- Monitor semantic coherence
- Validate stability metrics
- Verify adaptation mechanisms

### Pattern Monitoring (`test_vector_attention_monitor.py`)
- Track pattern evolution
- Validate attention mechanisms
- Verify monitoring accuracy

### Pattern Lifecycle (`test_pattern_emergence.py`)
- Test pattern states
- Verify transition logic
- Validate lifecycle events

## Test Execution Strategy

1. **Priority Order**:
   - Complete Pattern-Aware RAG tests first
   - Proceed with RAG integration tests
   - Finally, implement system integration tests

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Pattern processing must be stable before RAG integration
   - Learning windows must be verified before full cycle tests
   - Component tests must pass before system integration

3. **Quality Gates**:
   - All unit tests must pass
   - Integration tests must achieve 90% coverage
   - Performance metrics must meet thresholds

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**:
   - All test cases pass
   - No critical bugs remain
   - Edge cases handled properly

2. **Performance**:
   - Response times within specifications
   - Resource usage within limits
   - Stability under load

3. **Quality**:
   - Code coverage >= 90%
   - Documentation complete
   - All interfaces verified

## Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Pattern-Aware RAG Tests
2. **Week 2**: RAG Integration Tests
3. **Week 3**: System Integration Tests
4. **Week 4**: Performance Testing and Documentation

## Notes

- Test files are located in `/src/tests/`
- Each test suite has corresponding documentation
- Regular progress updates will be maintained
- Test results will be documented in CI/CD pipeline
