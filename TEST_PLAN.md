- Context Management
  - Temporal Context: Window state evolution

## 1. Pattern-Aware RAG Tests 🟡

### Semantic Pattern Testing (`test_semantic_pattern_validation.py`)

#### Testing Strategy
1. **Pattern Validation**
   - Validate climate hazard event types (extreme_precipitation, drought, wildfire, etc.)
   - Check temporal context completeness (created_at, last_modified)
   - Verify relationship coherence with metrics:
     * strength: Base relationship strength
     * spatial_distance: Spatial relationship metric
     * coherence_similarity: Pattern coherence
     * combined_strength: Overall relationship strength
   - Monitor pattern transitions
   - Track causal strength
   - Validate status tracking (GREEN/YELLOW/RED)
   - Verify validation history logging

2. **Neo4j Integration**
   - Test graph structure validity
   - Verify pattern persistence
   - Validate relationship preservation with required metrics
   - Check climate risk context
   - Validate node structure and event types
   - Verify relationship coherence
   - Test status tracking and history

### Graph State Foundation (`test_pattern_processing.py`)

#### Validation Patterns
The Pattern-Aware RAG system implements a two-level validation hierarchy to ensure data integrity:

1. **Semantic Validation** (During Initialization)
   - Relations must have non-empty types and non-negative weights
   - Pattern confidence must be above threshold (0.5)
   - Node IDs must be non-empty
   - Ensures invalid data is caught immediately during object creation

2. **Structural Validation** (During `validate_relations`)
   - State cannot be empty (no nodes, patterns, or relations)
   - Required components must exist (nodes and patterns)
   - Relations must reference valid nodes or patterns
   - Allows flexibility in when to check structural requirements

This separation of concerns allows partial states during construction while maintaining data integrity.

#### Test Coverage

  - Validate conflict resolution with multi-state merging

### Learning Window Control (`test_learning_window_control.py`)

## Test Execution Strategy

1. **Priority Order**:
   - Complete Pattern-Aware RAG tests first
   - Proceed with RAG integration tests
   - Finally, implement system integration tests

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Pattern processing must be stable before RAG integration
   - Learning windows must be verified before full cycle tests
   - Component tests must pass before system integration

3. **Quality Gates**:
   - All unit tests must pass
   - Integration tests must achieve 90% coverage
   - Performance metrics must meet thresholds

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**:
   - All test cases pass
   - No critical bugs remain
   - Edge cases handled properly

2. **Performance**:
   - Response times within specifications
   - Resource usage within limits
   - Stability under load

3. **Quality**:
   - Code coverage >= 90%
   - Documentation complete
   - All interfaces verified
