# Habitat Learning Windows

## Overview

Habitat Learning Windows provide a temporal framework for pattern evolution and emergence in the Pattern-Aware RAG system. This document details the integration flows, state management, and control mechanisms that enable adaptive pattern learning.

## Core Components

### 1. Window States
```
CLOSED -> OPENING -> OPEN -> CLOSED
```

- **CLOSED**: Not accepting changes
  - Initial state
  - Triggered by: low density, saturation, or expiration
  - Blocks pattern registration

- **OPENING**: Initialization phase
  - First minute of window lifecycle
  - Allows pattern observation
  - Builds initial coherence metrics

- **OPEN**: Active learning
  - Accepts pattern changes
  - Tracks evolution metrics
  - Manages back pressure

### 2. Integration Flows

## Key Integration Points

### 1. State Management
- Consistent window state transitions
- Standardized context handling (JSON)
- Unified pattern evolution tracking

### 2. Data Flow
- Field navigation -> Pattern discovery
- Pattern discovery -> Visualization
- Visualization -> Pattern relationships

### 3. Validation Chain
- Field coherence -> Pattern emergence
- Pattern evolution -> State transitions
- User interaction -> Interface updates

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Neo4j Integration
- Pattern identification (provenance + userID + patternID)
- Evolution tracking (graph relationships)
- User context storage

### 2. Direct LLM Mode
- Bypass Neo4j persistence
- Maintain pattern coherence
- Preserve event ordering

### 3. Back Pressure Implementation
```python
class BackPressureController:
    """Controls state change rate based on system stability."""
    
    def calculate_delay(self, stability_score: float) -> float:
        # Tree-like stress response model
        # Stability drops -> mechanical stress
        # System develops "memory" of stress patterns
        # Response strengthens in repeated stress areas
```

## Testing Framework

### 1. Integration Tests
- Window lifecycle validation
- State transition verification
- Back pressure response testing
- Event coordination checks

### 2. Performance Tests
- Concurrent pattern evolution
- Window saturation handling
- Back pressure effectiveness

### 3. Error Cases
- Invalid state transitions
- Window saturation handling
- Event coordination failures

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Window Creation
```python
window = event_coordinator.create_learning_window(
    duration_minutes=30,
    stability_threshold=0.7,
    coherence_threshold=0.6,
    max_changes=50
)
```

### 2. Event Processing
```python
delay = event_coordinator.queue_event(
    event_type="pattern_update",
    entity_id=pattern_id,
    data=pattern_data,
    stability_score=current_stability
)
```

### 3. State Monitoring
```python
stats = event_coordinator.get_window_stats()
# Returns: change_count, saturation, pressure, stability
```
